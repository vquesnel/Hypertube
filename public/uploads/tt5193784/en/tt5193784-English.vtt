00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.440
Blud, I'm not going to jail for you cuz,
I'm not going jail for no one.

3
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.885
You'll never understand how much I hate you.

4
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.087
You?

5
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.407
Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose.

6
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.610
# What's with the gossiping thing?

7
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.041
# Niggers know my style,
I'm going to bust in his teeth

8
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.124
# Get your facts right,
act right, don't act like

9
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.761
# Big Fetch, he never bust my teeth, yeah

10
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.405
# I get money, yeah, you know that

11
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.606
# Flash and fly, yeah,
you know my thing, yeah

12
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.845
# Any niggers want to
hate on the team, fuck them

13
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.763
# They wasn't with us in the first place

14
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.645
# Most as niggers know
If I make the phone call

15
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.603
# Everything's a go, go, go

16
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.446
# Yeah, car used to be a used...

17
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.608
# I can take a hit, I can take a loss

18
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.405
# But I can't take these
phat boys acting like they're us #

19
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.130
That was my man Freshky,
we're going to keep the energy rolling,

20
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.571
for Royston Peel!

21
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.885
# Think that I got to mention

22
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.450
# Hope I got your attention

23
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.604
# Cos I'm feeling some tension
Can you help me through it?

24
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.202
# Walls are falling around me
I can't live without boundaries

25
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.602
# Baby, I should think twice
before I go in the street

26
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.281
# People say that I'm restless
Building up so much stress

27
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.404
# And I don't wanna just guess
Before I enter this game

28
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.928
# Longing for a release
It's starting to feel like disease

29
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.647
# Just need my pleasure and please
As I'm not taking the blame

30
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.607
# So I can't be held
responsible for my actions you see

31
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.761
# I want to step over that
minefield placed down for me

32
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.123
# And we're going to lie to each other
and deny how it's going to be

33
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.725
# Because we're not the
only ones who do this, oh, every

34
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.771
# So I can't be held
responsible for my actions, you see

35
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.283
# And I want to step over that
minefield placed down for me

36
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.725
# And we're going to lie to each other
and deny how it's going to be #

37
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.646
I can't...

38
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.524
Can you remember his name?

39
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.284
I can't. I think it was...

40
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.570
His name is Mooks.

41
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.201
I'm gonna kill him.

42
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.520
Who's in here?

43
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.681
Oh, this guy.

44
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.289
I'm down, I'm down.

45
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.561
OK, OK, OK.

46
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.130
- Where's Mama?
- I don't know.

47
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.810
Oh. Oh.

48
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.001
OK, shoo, go play.

49
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.241
I'm going to get you.

50
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.926
How you doing?

51
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.443
I want some of this pussy before you go.

52
00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.806
How about you behave?

53
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.205
I could have done with you coming back
earlier to help get the kids ready.

54
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.611
I was working.

55
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.767
Did you go training?

56
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.282
- Do I not provide for my kids?
- You do.

57
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.045
So what's the problem?

58
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.521
The problem is the kids need their dad,

59
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.046
not some guy who just works
all the time and gives them money.

60
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.681
Take them to the park or something.

61
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.125
Well, that's what you do, I work four jobs.

62
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.884
Memories are just as important.

63
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.565
You know I don't like being around
a lot of people and the jobs change.

64
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.880
Too often.

65
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.803
"The boss didn't like me, I had to leave."

66
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.083
Look, I'm temping in this office later,
if they like me it could become permanent,

67
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.931
you know, my job is to provide and
protect this family and that's what I do.

68
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.205
How can you protect us if you're never here.

69
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.845
I'm a man I've got to pay my way.

70
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.641
You know law pays well, and when Mimi goes
to nursery full time I'm going back to work.

71
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.605
It doesn't make you less
of a man being with the kids.

72
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.643
No, I look after us, that's what I do!

73
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.611
Why do you push everyone away?

74
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.121
What if I spend too much time
with them and they end up like me?

75
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.281
I'd be proud.

76
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.127
You know what I'd love?

77
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.802
Every Sunday morning
I take the kids to the mall and

78
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.082
there's this little place
that we have breakfast in.

79
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.562
Every week I sit waiting and just hope that
one day you'll come in and surprise us.

80
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.884
Just us sitting there as a family.

81
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.046
That'd be nice.

82
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.046
I can button myself.

83
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.085
- Give Daddy a hug.
- Come here, Mimi.

84
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.247
Oh.

85
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.964
Thank you so much, that's so nice.

86
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.127
Big man!

87
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.127
Oh.

88
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.807
I want that...

89
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.285
- Is that for me? Yes?
- Yes.

90
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.365
- Hiya.
- How are you growing so fast?

91
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.442
Don't know.

92
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.250
Mum, Sam's here.

93
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.246
Come in.

94
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.604
Have a seat, I'll just get Mum.

95
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.321
Oh.

96
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.448
- Would you like a drink?
- No, I'm good thanks.

97
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.325
OK, I've got to go, I've got school.

98
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640
- All right.
- All right, wicked.

99
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.962
It's a good thing
I get up early for work, hello.

100
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.082
- How you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

101
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.921
Man, she is growing up fast,

102
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.122
you know, I'm ageing,
my hairline's gone back three inches, like.

103
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.969
But you don't even look like you're ageing.

104
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.565
I feel like I'm ageing.

105
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.608
- How's the little ones?
- Yeah, good, yeah, we're...

106
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.926
We're all right, yeah.

107
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.127
Good.

108
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.967
And then the gun went off and I woke up here.

109
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.045
OK.

110
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.246
Is there anything else you want to tell us?

111
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.565
I don't know anything.

112
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.611
You don't think this could be
connected to anyone you know?

113
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.048
No. That's not how I live my life.

114
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.247
All right.

115
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.682
Fi is doing really good,
she's doing English, Art, Film,

116
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.728
she's really creative, she must...

117
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.805
Well, she doesn't get that from me.

118
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.681
- Here.
- Absolutely not,

119
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.410
you were here six months ago, no.

120
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.408
Oh, please come on, let's not do this again.

121
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.325
You don't have to. I work.

122
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.925
- We don't even need it.
- I need it.

123
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.926
And I know it helps.

124
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.446
Her 16th birthday is coming up,
just get her something nice.

125
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.767
Thank you.

126
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.925
- See you.
- I'll see you later.

127
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.927
Sam.

128
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.804
You know one day
she's going to have to know, right?

129
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.807
Thank you very much.

130
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.125
Ah.

131
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.289
- I'm so sorry, I am so sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

132
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.767
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.928
Do you know how I can get to the London Eye?

134
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.805
Just get a taxi or get
on the Tube, it's easy.

135
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.604
I would, I would like to walk.

136
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.645
- Walk?
- Can you show me?

137
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.926
Thank you.

138
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.249
One hour 27 from here.

139
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.408
Can you put the directions in my phone?

140
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.605
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

141
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.289
Ah, shit, I...

142
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.644
I must have left my phone
at the hotel over there.

143
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.845
Can you come for me and put it in my maps?

144
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.365
No, babe, I've got somewhere to be.

145
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.761
Why don't you just ask reception
and someone can put it in for you?

146
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.564
Please? And I'm...

147
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.924
I can quickly clean your top,
since I messed it up.

148
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.926
What kind of hotel is this?

149
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.045
Hotel.

150
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.771
Serviced apartment, same thing.

151
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.091
My dad has money.

152
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.888
I'm just travelling.

153
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.967
Finding myself.

154
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.567
- How old are you?
- I'm 28, you?

155
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.246
- Older.
- Mmm.

156
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.124
- What's your name?
- Dominica, yours?

157
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.407
Mick.

158
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.247
Mick.

159
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.041
Oh, yeah, London Eye.

160
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.364
Um, your top please.

161
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.442
I will clean it quickly for you.

162
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.449
Thanks, Mick.

163
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.929
- What you doing?
- Maybe some of this before you go?

164
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.651
No, no. I get that at home.

165
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.404
No, no, this you don't.

166
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.086
This is special.

167
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.763
Just clean my fucking top
or give it back to me.

168
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.126
He doesn't want to leave.

169
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.647
No.

170
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.365
Baby, your mum is on her way.

171
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.044
I didn't tell her what happened.

172
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.246
Oh, right, thank you.

173
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.088
Oi, Solomon Northup,
have you got hold of my brother yet?

174
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.929
Listen, this slave talk
needs to stop, you know?

175
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.005
Anyway he's not answering,
I'll probably phone back in a bit.

176
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.206
All right, cool, cool.

177
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.762
Listen, so I want to
talk to you about yesterday.

178
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.971
What, about how much you care?

179
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.200
- Please, are you mad?
- What, how you almost cried?

180
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.441
You know I got told you cried on me.

181
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.647
"Oh, Royston."

182
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.325
Whatever. What are you talking about, man?

183
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.205
I never cried like that man, are you mad?

184
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.647
- Oi, what are you doing?
- Oh, what it's like that, Tupac?

185
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.921
What did you get shot or did I get shot?

186
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.405
- I'm going to remember that still.
- You remember it.

187
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.607
Apartheid, yeah?

188
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.722
You remember it, you remember it,
I know what you're like, bruv.

189
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.564
- Leave it man!
- You're a hater, bro.

190
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.206
Hello?

191
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.206
What?

192
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.204
Where is he?
Why am I only hearing about this now?

193
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.243
- Where's Royston?
- Oh, room three.

194
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.601
Yo.

195
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.765
When am I seeing my grandchildren, son?

196
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.410
It's been a few weeks.

197
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.329
I know, Mum, I'm sorry
I've just been busy, you know.

198
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.324
So shot yeah? What's going on?

199
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.405
I've said 100 times, a gun went off
in the club, I got scratched, I'm fine,

200
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.249
and no it wasn't aimed at me, Mum.

201
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.685
You sure?

202
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.966
Am I sure?

203
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.764
I haven't been in trouble since I was 17.

204
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.004
I drive a hybrid.

205
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.844
I work for a PR company.

206
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.410
I live with my civil engineer fiancee

207
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.205
and sing soul in my spare time,
like, yes, I'm sure.

208
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.805
Do you know what?

209
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.161
I'm going to head out, bro, all right?

210
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.163
- Take care, Mrs Peel.
- Be safe, young man.

211
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.565
See you later, Pen.

212
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.244
And hurry up and get better bro.

213
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.401
I've got bills to pay.

214
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.160
I'm going to probably go
as well, man, you know.

215
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.844
I've got a job interview
and since you are not dying,

216
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.205
I should probably go to that.

217
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.406
Bye, Mum.

218
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.520
- Penny.
- Bye.

219
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.845
Bro.

220
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.885
Yeah.

221
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.085
See you soon.

222
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.205
Yes, yes, I will bring
the kids to see you I promise.

223
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.964
Mmm-hmm.

224
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.287
Henry.

225
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.125
So, what's going on, man?

226
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.801
Yeah I'm all right, you know, self-employed.

227
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.805
Hey, you know me and
the missus make jewellery, right?

228
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.967
No.

229
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.321
Listen, we've got more tools
and metal in the boot than in Homebase.

230
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.605
We work our own hours.

231
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.761
You know how it is with a kid.

232
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.802
Although to be honest,
I don't think he's mine.

233
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.771
I think the missus played out on me.

234
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.840
You don't think your kid's yours?

235
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.287
He looks nothing like me.

236
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.405
- Do you play about on her?
- No.

237
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.291
Well not...

238
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.811
What do you want?

239
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.410
In the hospital you were
trying to tell me something.

240
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.923
Listen, I don't want to get involved but

241
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.968
I don't think what happened
to your brother was an accident.

242
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.444
I found this envelope
and it had your name on it.

243
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.724
- What are you talking about?
- Like...

244
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.925
Who was it from, where is it?

245
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.525
It's back at the flat,
I haven't even opened it.

246
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.766
I want to see it.

247
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.081
- Babe, you home?
- Hey, yeah, what's up?

248
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.331
Yeah, this, this way.

249
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.327
Ashanti, this is Sam,
Royston's older brother.

250
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.525
Sam, this is my wife Ashanti,
and this little man here is my son, Dhillon.

251
00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.204
Very nice to meet you.

252
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.363
Can you watch Dhillon for a bit please?
I need to head to the suppliers.

253
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.565
Yeah, sure.

254
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.846
I got some crystals earlier.

255
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.806
All right.

256
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.967
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

257
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.647
Bye, gorgeous.

258
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.160
Right, you see what I'm saying?

259
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.365
He looks nothing like me.

260
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.044
He looks exactly like you,
where's the envelope?

261
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.246
Over there.

262
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.406
So, who do you think it's from?

263
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.967
I don't know.

264
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.441
It's got an address at the back.

265
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.841
So what are you going to do?

266
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.447
Nothing.

267
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.526
I'm gone, man.

268
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.967
Hugs.

269
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.241
Yeah, I can't see him.

270
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.085
Yeah, I think I'm at the gate.
I didn't see which door he went in though.

271
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.647
Shut up.

272
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.965
Hugs.

273
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.242
I'm not Sherlock Holmes
out here, fam, I did follow him.

274
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.525
No you don't get to run,
you don't get to run.

275
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.443
You don't get to fucking run.

276
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.325
You're going to come here
to my house where my family live.

277
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.765
- It's not like that.
- Where my family live yeah?

278
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.285
- It's not like that.
- Yeah? Who fucking sent you here?

279
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.811
- Mooks.
- Who the fuck is Mooks?

280
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.082
- Mooks.
- Talk. Who is fucking Mooks?

281
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.601
Who the fuck are you?

282
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.125
Get up before I cut you, you prick.

283
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.321
- He's done my leg, bruv.
- Listen,

284
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.289
- if I've done anything to offend you man.
- Shut up.

285
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.844
Look at you begging, you pussy.

286
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.240
You know what, I'm going to cut you.

287
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.841
Why, what have I done?

288
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.680
You got the address on the card.

289
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.281
Come and find out.

290
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.845
I'm not just going to go to
some random address

291
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.725
when I don't even know
what's going on, I just need to know

292
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.325
that my missus and my kids are not in danger.

293
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.004
Everyone's in danger around you, aren't they?

294
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.406
I think it's because
you have an air of unlikeability.

295
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.243
I mean I've only just got here
and I don't like you already.

296
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.605
Unlikeability.

297
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.291
Now I'm not sure that's a word
but I am sure that I'm going to cut you,

298
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.686
and when I'm done with you I might
even come back and cut your kids.

299
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.447
No, you ain't going to touch my fucking kids.

300
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.762
You ain't going to touch my fucking kids,
you cut them and I'll fucking...

301
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.921
And what?

302
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.765
This is where my family live.

303
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.289
Now I don't care who you are,
you cross this line,

304
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.925
you cross this fucking line.

305
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.241
Get up.

306
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.810
I can't, bruv, I can't.

307
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.762
You've got the address,
and I'm still going to cut you, bitch.

308
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.001
Get in!

309
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

310
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.250
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

311
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.844
How you doing, you all right,
the kids are all right?

312
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.081
Yeah, we're good.

313
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.045
Bax is at school. I'm just with Mimi.

314
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.685
- You all right?
- Yeah, no. I'm fine.

315
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.725
I'm fine, just wanted
to make sure that you were.

316
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.525
You know you should
probably stay at your mum's tonight.

317
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.005
Why? What's going on?

318
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.845
You know, I'm just thinking
about what you said earlier,

319
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.809
and, you know, they're
really liking me at the place

320
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.321
and they said that I can have
a full time job interview tomorrow so

321
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.525
I just thought maybe
I could have a night alone.

322
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.523
- OK.
- I'll call you later.

323
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.241
OK, love you.

324
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.448
- Babe, your phone's ringing.
- All right.

325
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.321
- Hello?
- I need you to take me to the address.

326
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.525
What?

327
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.602
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. No, no, no, no.

328
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.761
Who is it?

329
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.325
Um...

330
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.402
- Sainsbury's.
- Sainsbury's?

331
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.845
Listen, I'm going to go to the address.

332
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.410
I need you to meet me there just in case.

333
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.284
Listen, no way.
Listen, I'm not getting involved.

334
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.921
In what?

335
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.447
Um...

336
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.525
They're offering me those
new middle of the day club cards

337
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.763
for people who shop in the day time.

338
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.921
Mmm.

339
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.331
- Sounds like a good idea.
- It's not.

340
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.406
It's not. Did you hear that?

341
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.565
It's not a good idea, it's a terrible idea.

342
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.449
- Why are you being so rude?
- Babe, I'm not being rude.

343
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.763
Henry, these people shot your friend
and they just came to my house.

344
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.045
- Let me speak to them.
- They asked to speak to Mr Okocha.

345
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.246
Are you Mr Okocha?

346
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.649
Listen, I'm not doing it, don't call back.

347
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.565
Yo, Yardz, you beat that Tonia ting yet?

348
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.525
I ain't beat it, I know
he's beat it though, bruv.

349
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.647
Let me get a sweet bruv.

350
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.365
One of you man pressed that,
don't think I don't know cuz.

351
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.725
- Oi, Drew, do you want a sweet fam?
- No fam I don't deal with that.

352
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.325
- You sure bruv? It's halal, cuz.
- Yeah.

353
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.402
- Get your hands off me.
- We're going to get nicked though fam.

354
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.165
Tonia, 18, you, 35.

355
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.525
You got that, fam?

356
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.284
Don, he's got about six kids, cuz.

357
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.411
What do you mean bruv?
We're just asking and I'm curious.

358
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.204
Bruv have you got your passport on you now?

359
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.085
Did you see that wino walking about?

360
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.242
- He's a dickhead, man.
- Is that how you talk about your friends?

361
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.765
Well, he's not really a friend.

362
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.365
I don't know why that pussy got sent anyway.

363
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.565
Do you think I would have
got clocked finding the dons house?

364
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.721
Never. Never fam.

365
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.962
I'd appreciate
if you didn't insult other men by

366
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.651
calling them an albeit
now accepted colloquial word

367
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.445
referring to the female genitalia
as if we're somehow weaker than you.

368
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.602
- You are weaker, look at you.
- Child birth.

369
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.920
You ain't even got kids.

370
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.604
So? I could still have them if I wanted to.

371
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.170
Wait, wait, wait, speaking of pussies yeah...

372
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.321
Look at all this stuff, Gaz was
snap chatting me all week bruv.

373
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.447
What, you steal that from cloud fam?

374
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.205
No, that's Alder's girl from the X1 crew, no?

375
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.685
If he fucks with me, I'm raping it.

376
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.885
Don't be so fucking vile.
What's the matter with you?

377
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.291
Really though why do girls do that?

378
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.605
Well, hang on,
I swear you hang with us, love.

379
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.841
None of you have fucked me.

380
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.922
Yeah, not yet you slag.

381
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.120
How many times have I said
don't stand out front?

382
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.770
Get inside.

383
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.966
Fucking hate that prick, man.

384
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.082
- Save it for the fucking test, bruv.
- Yeah, tell him.

385
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.084
- Yo, Hugs, Marshall hates you, fam.
- Shut up, man, I'll fucking punch you.

386
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.400
What the fuck you talking about you...

387
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.124
My legs, man, what's the fucking matter
with you cuz?

388
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.925
Get in the house, bruv, shut up.

389
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.523
Why are you still looking out the window?

390
00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.401
They said they might
deliver the club card today.

391
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.401
What's wrong with you?

392
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.165
I don't want their club card, babe.

393
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.685
What, a man can't live in his own country

394
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.842
without being offered free things
that give him discount?

395
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.322
If I want to pay full price
because I've earned it, that's my right.

396
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.002
That makes no sense.

397
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.684
Shut your fucking mouth.
Shut your fucking mouth.

398
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.365
Shut up. Do you understand?
Do you understand me, yeah?

399
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.171
Are the people
that are fucking with me here now?

400
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.167
Hmm?

401
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.245
Take me to them.

402
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.766
Which way? Which fucking way?

403
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.205
- Sacka ain't doing...
- Solid fam.

404
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.765
- Fuck all.
- Solid, bruv.

405
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.810
What do you mean solid? It ain't school or...

406
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.005
What the fuck? Let him go.

407
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.003
Well, what the fuck are you going to do?

408
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.082
Look behind you, prick.

409
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.804
A big man, yeah?

410
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.921
Soup.

411
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.243
You know I was the one that drove the boys
to shoot your brother, right?

412
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.921
Up.

413
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.925
If we wanted him dead he would be,
now you, you I said I'd cut.

414
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

415
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.446
Mooks wouldn't want blood
on the Indian marble, would he?

416
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.724
It's Indian.

417
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.406
Right, you lot go
and do whatever it is you lot do.

418
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.761
Let me speak with our guest.

419
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.130
Now I've just done you a favour,
so I'm hoping you'll agree to behave.

420
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.925
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let's go for a walk.

421
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.406
Ever hear of the Daley family?

422
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.681
Mob out of Essex.

423
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.762
Used to be run
by all the birds in the family,

424
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.081
people used to call us the Daley Females.

425
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.528
I mean, never to our faces,
no they weren't brave enough for that.

426
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.083
And then I came along.

427
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.329
And do you know what that makes me?

428
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.921
Well?

429
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.447
A cunt.

430
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.646
The Daley Male.

431
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.966
Get it?

432
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.605
And now I run it all.

433
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.409
Well, me and Mooks,

434
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.241
and there's a reason I'm telling you
all this, but we'll get to that.

435
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.885
Got a bit about you boy, ain't you?

436
00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.450
I like it.

437
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.364
Now the one with the Stanley knives
is called Hugs

438
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.284
cos he likes to cuddle people
when he stabs them,

439
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.243
and he's a horrible little bastard.

440
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.971
Now he used to work for Mister
when he was younger.

441
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.809
Who are you talking about?

442
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.285
The Chakra.

443
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.725
Huh?

444
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.770
Never mind mate,
it's just something they used to say.

445
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.284
Still thinking about that club card?

446
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.841
Huh?

447
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.763
Oh, oh, um...

448
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.606
Yeah.

449
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.964
Yeah, I think it was a good deal, you know.

450
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.649
Just go and pick it up tomorrow.

451
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.920
I think it was one of those
one day only things.

452
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.004
Yeah, you know what, I might just go
get one of them now, you know, I think.

453
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.721
Yeah, I think I might just do that now, be...
I won't be long, OK? See you later.

454
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.806
Anything that people want, we can facilitate,
and I need people to run it for me.

455
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.922
Imported foreign slags.

456
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.126
Do whatever I tell them.

457
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.851
You.

458
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.971
You want to fuck one?

459
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.924
No? All right.

460
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.920
I fucked them all.

461
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.605
I love a foreign slag.

462
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.125
Mooks won't fuck them though.

463
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.446
He won't touch this lot.

464
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.762
He likes them high class escorts,

465
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.161
and he must have fucked
everyone in Kensington.

466
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.765
He fucks them,
then beats the shit out of them,

467
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.161
and I mean it's nasty
but what are they going to do?

468
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.685
I just want to know
who's messing with my family.

469
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.285
Scared, ain't you?

470
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.245
See, things have changed
since you was a fucking bad boy,

471
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.205
it's all about the money now,

472
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.925
and me, I've got a few million
in a safe at home.

473
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.083
So I ain't got to worry about which one
of my muscle is gonna stab me in the back,

474
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.845
cos I pay them well enough
to do what I tell them.

475
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.921
See people don't speak about
what they see in here,

476
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.845
cos well I might be smiling, boy,

477
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.082
but no one fucks with me or Mooks.

478
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.089
Anyway, back to my point.

479
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.524
Opportunity.

480
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.922
You come work for me
and I'll change shit for you.

481
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.524
Your kids, that little
chocolate wife you've got,

482
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.963
I'll make the madness stop.

483
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.605
So what do you think?

484
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.447
No.

485
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.691
All right.

486
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:36.124
Down the stairs, turn right,
through the double doors.

487
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.243
You remember me, boy?

488
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.811
I had a lot of time to think

489
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.885
about what I was going to do to you
when I got out of jail.

490
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.122
My brother was nothing to do with that.

491
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.162
So just tell me what I need to do
to make this stop and I'll do it.

492
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.850
Where are you?

493
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.605
Well I'm here, you made me come here.

494
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.920
No, no.

495
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.926
Where are you?

496
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.525
"Where gone? You get me?"

497
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.921
I don't talk like that any more.

498
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.241
- Why not?
- I grew up.

499
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.120
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose."

500
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.931
Remember?

501
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.766
Where is he?

502
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.962
I know he's still in there.

503
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.767
That's who I want.

504
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.323
I'm not playing this game with you
so leave my family alone.

505
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.086
It's interesting you say those words,
"My family".

506
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.365
Because I have no family
and that's your fault,

507
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.930
so now,

508
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.444
I have nothing to lose.

509
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.601
Everything you've take from me,
Trevor, everything else,

510
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.444
I want it back.

511
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.325
But I...

512
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.449
I don't want to take this on.

513
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.365
I want the rude boy back,

514
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.651
the youth that dared to take me on,
because this is only gonna end one way.

515
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.921
Look.

516
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.129
Times change.

517
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.765
People change.

518
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.286
No matter how many times you're told,

519
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.085
you never really get it
when you're young, but you learn.

520
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.970
People that were so important
in your life for whatever reason

521
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.526
disappear and new people take their place.

522
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.121
But, you know, it's weird how
through all of that you can do this one thing

523
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.925
that people think defines what you're about.

524
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.289
And it doesn't matter if you're sorry,

525
00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.121
it doesn't even matter if you embrace it
as a part of who you are.

526
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.925
No matter how much you try to move on,

527
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.764
no matter how much you try to evolve,

528
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.161
no matter how much you try
to dull the memory of it

529
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.845
or explain to people
that you've improved as a person,

530
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.809
they always try and drag you back in.

531
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.364
And I remember what I said,
I remember I said,

532
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.683
"Never fuck with a guy
who ain't got nothing to lose,"

533
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.444
but I was wrong.

534
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.084
Because the only person more dangerous
than someone with nothing to lose...

535
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.971
Is someone who stands to lose everything.

536
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.885
Fuck me, this is great.

537
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.090
It's like watching two fucking
silverback monkeys waiting to fight.

538
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.969
He came to me couple of months ago,
arse hanging out,

539
00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.685
I offered him a load of cash,
he didn't want it.

540
00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.765
All he wanted was for me
to facilitate him fucking with you.

541
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.565
Well, I don't miss a bargain.

542
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.205
Please don't do this.

543
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.044
No, hold on.

544
00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.088
I just offered you a way out.

545
00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.925
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, what am I like?

546
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.365
Janette?

547
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.602
Janette, get in here, love.

548
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.649
Hello, Sam.

549
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.603
Sorry, Mick.

550
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.364
How has your day been?

551
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.681
This is just the start.

552
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.763
I'm not done with you.

553
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.081
I'll destroy everything you love.

554
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.125
Fuck.

555
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.565
Fucking what are you like, bruv?

556
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.130
Go on, cuz.

557
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.811
What, you want to try that again
without your pool balls, cuz?

558
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.410
- Just let him go.
- Shut up.

559
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.682
Yo fam, you're old cuz,
go look after your grandkids.

560
00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.967
You has-been.

561
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.161
Just get out of my way, blud.

562
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.125
Did you just say "blud"?

563
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.925
No one says blud any more cuz, like...

564
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.923
What year you living in?

565
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.446
Do you know what? I know,
he wants to fuck with the young'uns

566
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.251
like he's some fucking
Rolf Harris or something.

567
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.925
Fuck you.

568
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.525
Hey!

569
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.365
What, you'll get your chin lifted
around here bruv.

570
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.761
You can't do fuck all to me.

571
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.527
It was me who shot your brother,
what the fuck are you going to do about that?

572
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.525
Hugs! Hugs!

573
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.761
Leave him.

574
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.921
Going to bang my mouth are you's?

575
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.045
Leave him. Get off.

576
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.165
He's just banged me in my face,
he's not going to hold a shot no?

577
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.321
He's got to hold a couple shots at least.

578
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.085
Oi, move, move. Oi, back up! Back up!

579
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.811
Get back. Or I'll heat up in here, yeah?

580
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.083
Mine's a shotter. A shotter.

581
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.205
Come on, come on, come on.

582
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.325
Is that a sonic hat?

583
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.845
Go, go, go.

584
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.001
That's a shotter you know.

585
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.081
Fucking hell.

586
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.205
That was a mad thing, we fucked him up.

587
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.441
Why did you let him up?

588
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.443
Bruv he had a strap bruv,
I was about to get bursted.

589
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.885
What, the guy in the suede shoes
and the fucking lumberjack shirt?

590
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.765
- I don't know, you never know these days cuz.
- You prick. Come here.

591
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.081
What the fuck are you doing cuz?

592
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.286
- What are you doing?
- Fucking little Muppet.

593
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.561
Nah. Nah, nah.

594
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.130
What the fuck bruv?

595
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.205
Come here, come here. Come here.

596
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.327
Hey.

597
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.603
Did you give them the finger?

598
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.725
What about you?

599
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.685
Back up before I heat it up,
what are you fucking cooking?

600
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.885
I don't know what kids say these days.

601
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.611
- I just wanted to get you out.
- What kind of getaway car is this?

602
00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:06.275
This is not a getaway car,
this is a family car.

603
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.525
I've got the child seat in the back,

604
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.446
a ninja turtle I pretended was a gun,
and this is my son's hat.

605
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.807
So how about "Thank you
for coming to get me," huh?

606
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.809
How about that?

607
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.921
Thank you.

608
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.410
By the way if your son's hat fits you
it's definitely your kid.

609
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.165
Are you trying to say I've got a big head?

610
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.686
Or you trying to say my son's got a big head?

611
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.688
Now my cousin Jerry, now he's got a big head.

612
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.242
- I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Fuck you man.

613
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.970
- Come here.
- No bruv you took it too far.

614
00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.525
My bad, look I'm sorry,
come here give me a hug.

615
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.602
You're one of my boys, please,
give me a cuddle.

616
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.165
Bruv I know you've got
a fucking shank in your...

617
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.287
Am I a dickhead cuz?

618
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.885
I ain't got nothing in my hands,
I ain't got nothing.

619
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.845
Nothing in my hands. Give me a hug.

620
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.809
- All right man, all right.
- Just come here.

621
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.160
- Come on, come on.
- Fuck off man.

622
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.322
Come on, that's it, yeah.

623
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.766
Oi, keep your head.

624
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.088
Get in the Jeep.

625
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.005
Get in the fucking Jeep and remember
why you're not on the pavement with him.

626
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.084
Get in the Jeep.

627
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.604
FYI, I don't like you either.

628
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.325
- Then I came straight here.
- OK.

629
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.801
They're the ones that shot my brother,
they told me.

630
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.843
Tell me something that gives me
a reason to visit Daley

631
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.843
and we'll look at Curtis as well.

632
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.003
OK, look, they had weapons there and drugs

633
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.970
and girls, like sex slaves
and a lot of other shit.

634
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.404
I mean, look I just need to know
that Kayla and the kids are going to be safe.

635
00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.170
Can you do that?

636
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.684
You saw all of this?

637
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.165
Its run by some guy called Daley,
there's some guy called Hugs, there's Curtis,

638
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.004
and a guy called Mooks but I never met him.

639
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.205
We've been after that Daley for years,
just no one wants to talk.

640
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.248
You just can't tie it to me, Des.

641
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.251
I won't.

642
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.691
I promise.

643
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.763
So Marshall won't be joining us any more.

644
00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.411
As long as he remembers the rules.

645
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.923
What's this called again, Curtis?

646
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.765
He said Guinness Pineapple Punch, babe.

647
00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.242
Guinness Pineapple Punch.

648
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.684
Don't have make some concoctions you lot.

649
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.410
What about Sam?

650
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.765
He's not gonna bite.

651
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.844
Maybe it's time to give him
a little more incentive.

652
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.571
That's why you made me do it, right?

653
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.529
Poppy, come here.

654
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.731
I want you to do something for me.

655
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.324
I am not sucking your cock.

656
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.164
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

657
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.165
What's up?

658
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.329
Did you get the club card?

659
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.203
Oh, uh, no, babe, it was crazy, yeah,
I couldn't even get to them.

660
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.408
Kids were crying,
women were climbing over stuff.

661
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.002
There were these two women fighting,
I swear, I see titties fall out and everything.

662
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.805
They just popped out.

663
00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.201
- Sounds awful.
- It was.

664
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.688
What are you doing here?

665
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.610
I live here.

666
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.600
Where are the kids?

667
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.647
Want to tell me about this?

668
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.208
Girl just left it, said I should watch it.

669
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.364
Just turn it off.

670
00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.369
Why would you do this to us?

671
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.325
- Please just turn it off.
- I want to finish watching it.

672
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.243
- Turn it off!
- No!

673
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.642
Get off! Get off me!

674
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.125
Get off me!

675
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.447
Get off me.

676
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.965
I'm sorry.

677
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.561
Were you sorry when your cock was inside her?

678
00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.409
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing?

679
00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.124
- No, it's all right...
- No, you can't come in here.

680
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.245
Listen, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, listen.

681
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.687
The neighbours just complained
about too much noise.

682
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.765
Oh, what a coincidence
seeing all you lot here.

683
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.081
Well, since we're here we're wondering
if we could step inside

684
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.205
and have a little chat about a few things.

685
00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.325
Like what?

686
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.243
A young man named Marshall Brevitt,

687
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.370
who we know you're associated with,
well, he ended up in A&E today.

688
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.521
You know anything about that?

689
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.085
Has he said anyone does?

690
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.722
No, the poor kid's having trouble speaking,
but he will though.

691
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.925
Don't you have anything better
to do, little girl?

692
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.411
Don't you, piggy?

693
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.925
Like shooting unarmed black men

694
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.645
so posh kids can loot shops
and let poor kids take the blame?

695
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.963
Well, maybe we think there's something
going on in here that we should know about.

696
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.451
What's made you think that then?

697
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.325
Now as far as I can see
you ain't got a warrant

698
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.285
and you definitely ain't got
any evidence of anything untoward,

699
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.604
cos well there ain't nothing happening.

700
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.050
So... Evanesco.

701
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.002
- What?
- Never mind.

702
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.083
Just something they used to say.

703
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.324
Point is, you're trespassing
on private property,

704
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.122
little suggestion, I'd do one
cos Mooks won't like it.

705
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.645
Is that a threat?

706
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.961
Why doesn't Mooks tell us himself?

707
00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.088
Oh, that's not a threat.

708
00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.645
Get out of my house before I have you gutted
and spread on my sesame seed bagel.

709
00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.210
That's a threat.

710
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.885
I'm going to get you, Daley.
Mooks, Hugs, Curtis.

711
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.364
I'm coming for you.

712
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.962
I look forward to it, son.

713
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.527
You know the saddest thing?

714
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.923
I put so much into us.

715
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.171
All the people that said
not to give you a chance.

716
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.448
Am I just not good enough?

717
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.681
What's she got that's any better than me?

718
00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.731
I fucking...

719
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.121
Oh!

720
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.290
They set me up.

721
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.365
I don't care if she fell off a rainbow
with a pot of gold,

722
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.725
pizza in each hand, legs spread,
beer coming out her arse.

723
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.565
Have some fucking respect
for yourself, for me,

724
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.440
the woman that's had your child
and does everything for this family.

725
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.603
For our little girl.

726
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.764
For your little boy that I raised as my own,

727
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.725
who had nightmares for six months

728
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.245
after playing in a room for hours

729
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.891
while his mum lay dead
with a needle in her arm.

730
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.643
Stop blaming other people for your fuck-ups.

731
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.084
You know it's funny you say
you want to protect this family,

732
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.202
who's gonna protect us from you?

733
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.560
Hugs.

734
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.525
Let's talk about the police
you brought to my house.

735
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.325
I didn't bring the police
to your house, Daley.

736
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.882
Uh, well, that Sam brought the police
to my house,

737
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.691
we know he did because
nobody we know would dare to.

738
00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.965
Sam was here because of Curtis.

739
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.849
Curtis is here because of you,

740
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.562
so by default you brought the police
to my house.

741
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.285
Mooks ain't gonna be happy.

742
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.442
Well, tell me what you want done
to Sam and I'll do it.

743
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.131
If you want to draw this Sam out,
draw him out properly.

744
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.602
I'm done with the fucking games, Curtis.

745
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.967
He loves his family, hurt one of them.

746
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.648
Why you don't let me deal
with him the way I want?

747
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:59.247
The deal was I work for you,
you let me do what I want with him.

748
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.606
Listen.

749
00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.725
Listen to me, you Planet of the Ape
monkey magic coon.

750
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.723
You said you'd do anything I want.

751
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.202
All you wanted was to get back
in the game and get this fucking Sam,

752
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.282
draw him out so he'd come for you.

753
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.283
Well, he come, and he broke my rules,

754
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.805
so now what I want is for you to find
one of his family and cut them.

755
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.929
Now you want the bad boy
he used to be, that'd do it.

756
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.403
Finish him like you said you would
or Mooks will finish you.

757
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:54.007
Do you understand me
or do I need to translate to fucking monkey?

758
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.766
Let me know when you're ready
to take over, yeah?

759
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.845
He won't even feel it.

760
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.967
Soon.

761
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.921
Hmm.

762
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.967
- Hello.
- Ah!

763
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.089
You ready for war?

764
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.687
Go away.

765
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.571
Whatever happened to your white girl, Lexie?

766
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.845
I hear she overdosed

767
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.163
and they found her on the floor
with a vibrator in her arse.

768
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.848
I mean, that's what I hear.

769
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.888
It's not like I could have got people
to get out again.

770
00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.322
How could I do that?

771
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.969
I was in my cell.

772
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.610
We's going to do this,

773
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.565
just let me know when.

774
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.601
All I know is you'd best
leave me your number.

775
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.684
24th floor. Doors opening.

776
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.649
Hey, this is us, man, come on, man.

777
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.206
Doors closing.

778
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.725
Doors opening.

779
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.447
Hey!

780
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.367
Let's get out of here.

781
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.525
- Are you all right?
- Help me.

782
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.325
- Are you all right?
- They took my things.

783
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.925
I need to call my friend.

784
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.163
Come on. Come on, come in here.

785
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.965
Come in here.

786
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.726
Tell me what happened.

787
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.447
Thank you.

788
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.725
I thought you said they took all your things.

789
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.883
They did, but I hid my phone,
it was instinct.

790
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.365
Well, they'll be gone now,

791
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.965
so, once you've finished your water,
I'll walk you out.

792
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.087
Thank you.

793
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.687
Hi, Mum.

794
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.688
Good morning, son, how are you today?

795
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.447
Yeah, I'm good, you?

796
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.645
Not bad.

797
00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.609
I'm gonna go and see your brother in a while.

798
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.407
You all right?

799
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.044
Listen, I saw two men mugging a girl
outside on the walkway,

800
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.361
- so I let her come in for a bit.
- Why would you let her in?

801
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.284
I couldn't leave her outside.
What should I do?

802
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.848
- What does she look like?
- Sorry?

803
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.921
What does she look like?

804
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.803
Quite pretty, brunette.

805
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.881
Does she have an accent?

806
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.602
Hold on, it's the door going.

807
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.807
- I'll call you back.
- Mum, does she have an ac... Mum!

808
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.966
What are you doing?

809
00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.965
They used to treat me like the others,

810
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.407
but things are much better for me now.

811
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.326
What does that mean?

812
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.606
Don't you dare open that door.

813
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.161
I have to.

814
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.401
No!

815
00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.689
I have a little problem with your son.

816
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.763
And you think threatening his mother

817
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.969
- is going to get you what you want?
- You're right.

818
00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.250
Threatening isn't going to do it.

819
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.525
Oh, my God!

820
00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.761
No!

821
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.681
That should do it.

822
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.683
Hey. All or nothing, right?

823
00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.128
We need to go. Get her.

824
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.769
Oh, my God!

825
00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.920
Move over to this side.
Move over to this side.

826
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.404
Sir, sir, no, you can't go
through there, sir.

827
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.922
PC Johnston, can you sort that out, please?

828
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.410
I'm sorry, sir, please, can you keep back?

829
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.644
Can you stay back sir, please?

830
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.761
Sir.

831
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.603
Hey! Hey! Get back here!

832
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.160
Get off me.

833
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.407
Can we get some backup, please!

834
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.400
I've had the assault-on-an-officer
charges dropped.

835
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.446
You're free to go.

836
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.130
We sent a unit to Daley's house.
They've all gone.

837
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.647
Sam.

838
00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.921
Penny's pregnant.

839
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.401
There's something else.

840
00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.724
Didn't know if this was gonna be
a good time to tell you,

841
00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.404
cos I'm not sure when I'll see you again.

842
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.565
Penny's work visa for America came through,

843
01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.324
so we're moving out there.

844
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.401
Connecticut.

845
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.929
We'd love to see you out there one day.

846
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.411
But I don't need to know what...

847
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.321
I know there's more going on here
than you're letting anyone know.

848
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.286
I wanna say I hate you.

849
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.163
I want to tell you I fucking hate you,

850
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.807
cos I don't understand how
Mum had to get involved,

851
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.921
but I don't.

852
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.606
You're my big brother.

853
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.329
So, if I could say anything to you now,

854
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.082
is that I want you to handle it,

855
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.809
cos that's the least Mum
and the rest of us deserve.

856
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.687
- What you doing?
- I'm gonna go back to my mums.

857
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.644
Got some fresh clothes for the kids.

858
01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.601
What?

859
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.921
You thought because we had sex,
everything was forgotten?

860
01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.321
Well, what was it then?

861
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.610
It was about me loving you,

862
01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.165
despite myself loving you,

863
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.084
but for the sake of me and my kids,
I'm not coming back into this mess.

864
01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.241
Baxter's my son.

865
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.765
Well, you can have me
arrested for kidnapping,

866
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.605
because I'm not bringing that little boy back
into whatever it is you're involved in.

867
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.082
So, when all of this is over,

868
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.611
when you can look me in the eye
and say it's done,

869
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.930
I'll think about coming back.

870
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.926
Hey, babe.

871
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.401
You're a dead man.

872
01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.651
There's the monster I want.

873
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.284
There's the monster I want!

874
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.765
I'm just putting it out there,
I'm coming for you,

875
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.285
when I see you, you're fucking dead.

876
01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.806
Come on!

877
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.601
Come on!

878
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.761
I ready. Come on.

879
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.925
You work for Mooks, don't you?

880
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.651
Couple weeks back,
my sister was raped by that fucker.

881
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.602
Mooks said he only fucks
and beats up escorts.

882
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.738
You're not to judge my life.

883
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.410
That's my little fucking sister.

884
01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.761
Three days ago, I came
and I heard you mention his name,

885
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.080
and I saw the gun,

886
01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.284
and I want it, I need it.

887
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.761
What for?

888
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.803
There are people that are
threatening my family.

889
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.604
My mum died and I know they did it.

890
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.401
Where is he?

891
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.086
I never saw him.

892
01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.924
They've gone into hiding.
So now I don't know where to find him.

893
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.921
Let us know when you do.

894
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.445
Cos I'm not letting this shit go.

895
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.245
Babe, look at the extension on this house.

896
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.810
I know, can you imagine how much that costs?

897
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.445
Soon as we get making a bit more money, yeah.

898
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.287
- Hello.
- I need you to drive me somewhere.

899
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.725
I can't, man, I'm watching
Make My House A Home.

900
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.961
I'll text you where I am.

901
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.687
Who was that?

902
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.447
Royston.

903
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:48.924
He just rang me to tell me
about this 1:00 a.m. 90% off sale

904
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.321
at Trumpet and Horn Music Shop.

905
01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.364
Wants me to go down there
and collect some stuff up for the band.

906
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.169
Isn't he moving to America though?

907
01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.001
Yeah, but he'll be back.

908
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.650
I don't know, what about me?
Maybe I want to go solo.

909
01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.969
And how can I miss the bargain
of 90% off a trumpet, babe?

910
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.920
You don't play trumpet.

911
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.604
Well, maybe I want to learn.

912
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.685
Are you lying to me?

913
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.161
Babe, come on, my little blackberry.

914
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.401
Come here.

915
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.960
Listen, I'm going to go
check out this bargain quickly, all right,

916
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.809
you carry on watching the show,
I'm not going to be long.

917
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.287
Let me know what the bungalow's saying,
I'll be back soon as possible.

918
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.084
Babe, you look nice and pretty,
just stay there.

919
01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.807
So what are we doing here?

920
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.763
I wanted to double check
but the house is empty.

921
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.080
Sam, I've got to go home.

922
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.205
Please, I just need you...
Just give me help for one more night

923
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.165
I've already lied to my missus twice for you.

924
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.402
We're friends, man. They killed my mum.

925
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.931
Your brother's my friend, not you.

926
01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.924
What if they come after my kids next?

927
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.681
Hmm? Or yours?

928
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.081
What if he ain't mine?

929
01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.601
Grow the fuck up, man,
your missus ain't cheating on you.

930
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.847
OK.

931
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.689
I told Ashanti we'd be out till morning,

932
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.409
so you've got my help for one night,

933
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.449
and after that I'm done.

934
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.921
I'm driving.

935
01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.005
# Told him don't leave the block
until my weed's done

936
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.526
# Don't flip my peas,
bring it back like a refund

937
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.765
# Ever since we cut out the middle man

938
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.241
# Princess cuts like a sliced Kate Middleton

939
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.605
# I can't stop grinding, cut a mean profit

940
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.411
# Four fifth making blast off team rocket

941
01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.205
# It's that Nina with the Nina shit

942
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.851
# Pull out on bus like
I ain't trying to breed a chick

943
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.802
# My biggest fear is being a broke nigger

944
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.525
# Them OGs fill up like an old sticker

945
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.285
# It don't even matter
if the package came a halfshort

946
01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.449
# Stamped on the eighth
like the back of my passport

947
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.525
# How these niggers starts
on their own makes stacks

948
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.765
# I'm in an old car fucking made back
Any stars say my name then it's payback

949
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.923
# Shooting at the stars like
I'm trying to turn space black

950
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.523
# I wear it once then it's all gone

951
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.604
# I've got 20 carrots glistening on both arms

952
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.407
# I'll bring her home with me if she has back

953
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.925
# I make her run like water
when I tap that, when I tap that... #

954
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.402
Hey, ain't that one of the guys we saw
from earlier going into the chip shop?

955
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.004
Yeah, that's one of them fuckers there.

956
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.128
- Careful though, they're hot, yeah.
- Thank you.

957
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.525
Nice one, yeah. Thank you.

958
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.971
Henry Henry Oi, what's happened?

959
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.845
Hey, and don't do anything too crazy yeah?

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.601
Henry.

961
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.601

962
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.401
Henry, oi!

963
01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.847

964
01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.605
- Henry!
- Hello.

965
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.926
Who are you talking to?

966
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.406
I'm near the sale.

967
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.841
No, I Googled, there is no sale.

968
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.242
Babe, it's a secret sale,

969
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.243
you know they don't
put them things on the website.

970
01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.325
Where the fuck is Curtis?

971
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.811
I don't know, big man. I don't know.

972
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.921
- Get out!
- Get out!

973
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.082
I don't want no trouble. Hassan! Problem!

974
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.404
Hey! Stop it!

975
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.525
- What's happening?
- Babe, I'm parked on a red line

976
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.409
and there's some traffic warden
trying to give me a ticket.

977
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.090
Really? Let me speak to him.

978
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.447
Huh?

979
01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.763
Let me speak to him.

980
01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.521
Shit.

981
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.806
Fucking prick.

982
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.809
What the fuck you going
to do now, you little pussy?

983
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.525
You see my Kurdish brother?

984
01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.170
Yeah, you're fucked up, what now?

985
01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.807
Fuck.

986
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.241
So where is he then?

987
01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.122
Hello? Hello, madam?

988
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.287
Oh, um...

989
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.807
Why are you giving my husband
a ticket at 4:00 a.m.?

990
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.765
Are you stupid? I work the night shift.

991
01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.320
He's parked in the wrong place.

992
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.802
Listen, don't call me stupid, yeah,
what night shift are you talking about?

993
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.924
Oi, listen, don't talk to my wife like that.

994
01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.131
What are you going to do?

995
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.402
Yo, don't test me, you know.

996
01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.646
Are you going to assault me?

997
01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.365
Babe, babe, babe, babe. Just leave it, yeah.

998
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.249
He's an arsehole, just move the car.

999
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.761
OK, baby.

1000
01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.885
Sorry, reception, babe,
I've got to go, see you later, bye.

1001
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.327
Henry! Oi! If you're ever lying...

1002
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.967
Henry!

1003
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.007
Fuck!

1004
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.010
Samir, I hear about your mother, I'm sorry.

1005
01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.769
Hassan, I've been coming to your shop
for five years, big man.

1006
01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.924
You know how long I know Samir?

1007
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.642
25 years. Ladbroke Grove boys.

1008
01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.762
He cleaned with me in my brother's shop.

1009
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.924
You think it mean anything to me
that you come and eat here for five years?

1010
01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.685
Yeah, you want that? There, there.
There. Here. Here is your five years.

1011
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.045
I've known Samir since we were 10 years old.

1012
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.921
He tried to rob me for masked crusaders.

1013
01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.402
Ah, very good toys.

1014
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.365
Little man could go in car
and it transformed.

1015
01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.445
Not quite Transformers,
but I like better than Solus Robot.

1016
01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.924
I wonder why they never make a movie of this?

1017
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.525
Michael Bay might still.

1018
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.125
- He better not!
- Ah!

1019
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.925
No, he kill my childhood.

1020
01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.005
He fuck everything, Transformers, Turtles.
I want to strangle him.

1021
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.969
Anyway, what is problem?

1022
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.442
He thinks it's good to fuck around
with people's families.

1023
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.968
Family is off limits.

1024
01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.286
Where are Curtis and Daley?

1025
01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.447
I don't know.

1026
01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.923
Hassan! Fuck's sake!

1027
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.004
Big man, I don't know where
anyone is, I swear down, bruv.

1028
01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.161
You want me to cut him?

1029
01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.365
I turn him into saveloy,
drunk, white man will never tell.

1030
01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.283
Hassan, please man.

1031
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.124
Snapchat will tell you where they are.

1032
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.605
Samir, brother.

1033
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.687
If they fuck with you and you need me,

1034
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.921
you let me know.

1035
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.765
And you, you never, never come here again.

1036
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.081
- No chips, no chilli sauce, nothing!
- I don't want chips...

1037
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.685
Why do you waste your time with them?

1038
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.410
Why did you when you were young?

1039
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.967
Where we going?

1040
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.170
You still got those tools in the boot?

1041
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.448
Do you know Yardz and Drew? Where are they?

1042
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.161
Yardz is...

1043
01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.921
Oh.

1044
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.168
Drew's at that little park down the road.

1045
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.327
Show me.

1046
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.289
They say you're the boy looking for me.

1047
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.281
- What's the point of this?
- Shut the fuck up, man.

1048
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.605
Yo, you're a creep, bruv.

1049
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.770
Teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.

1050
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.401
Who the fuck's that?

1051
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.762
Don't stop, no, he's just a little goon.

1052
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.923
Come on, big man, step up.

1053
01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.126
Oh, fuck!

1054
01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.167
Fucking hell.

1055
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.124
Tell the men to go, tell them to go.

1056
01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.561
Go on then, fuck off.

1057
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.766
- Tell them to go.
- Fuck off!

1058
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.365
Fuck! Oh, you cunt.

1059
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.681
You think the boys are going to
pay your bills when you're older?

1060
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.525
You think they're going to
look after you if you go inside?

1061
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.161
I've got money, I've got power. I'm good.

1062
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.089
You think you've got power
because you've got a hammer?

1063
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.565
Getting a job, owning
your own place, that's power.

1064
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.687
Don't preach to me.

1065
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.089
My little brother's six years old, yeah,

1066
01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.925
and he can't get into
no fucking primary school in the borough

1067
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.365
because there ain't no fucking space.

1068
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.680
I've got to teach him.

1069
01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.927
We don't riot because we want to,
we riot because we have to.

1070
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.090
Fucking hell.

1071
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.922
You shot my brother
and I know you did my mum,

1072
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.411
so tell me what the fuck I need to know.

1073
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.529
I thought you didn't want any trouble.

1074
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.287
I changed my mind.

1075
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.082
This is your last chance, little boy.

1076
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.607
I was where you are now 10 years ago,

1077
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.169
and I got a brick to the back of the head.

1078
01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.088
Because of all that medical shit it caused,

1079
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.965
I can't hold down a job,

1080
01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.244
I work with my wife
selling fucking jewellery.

1081
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.251
And I love my wife, but we're struggling.

1082
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.409
How the fuck are you struggling
when you're driving this?

1083
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.601
We are!

1084
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.602
I won this in a doughnut eating contest.

1085
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.847
What doughnuts?

1086
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.967
Krispy Kremes.

1087
01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.400
They're a good doughnut store.

1088
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:31.244
But the point is, I wish I had someone
to tell me what I'm telling you now.

1089
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.084
I fucking wish it.

1090
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.401
Answer it.

1091
01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.851
- Hello.
- Henry!

1092
01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.806
What is going on?

1093
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.764
I've been lying to you, babe.

1094
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.082
God I knew it. Who is she?

1095
01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.646
Who is she? Do I know her?

1096
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.604
Because I will punch the bitch up, you know,
where's my cosh?

1097
01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.000
No, it's not like that.

1098
01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.244
I've been helping Sam find out
who shot Royston.

1099
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.609
I've been driving him around,
he thinks they killed his mum too,

1100
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.600
but now I've got myself into a situation.

1101
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.931
I'm scared I'm not going to see you again.

1102
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.926
God, please be OK, please.

1103
01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.010
Just know that I'm yours forever.

1104
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.286
I love you so much. I do.

1105
01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.127
And you know your son loves you.

1106
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.327
Good, he is...

1107
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.922
He is mine, isn't he?

1108
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.445
Of course he's your son.

1109
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.409
OK. I've got to go.

1110
01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.086
I'm done.

1111
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.526
Do what you can with that,
see where it gets you.

1112
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.531
I finally understand why my friend's
on this now.

1113
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.611
You fuck up more than one life
if you do anything to me.

1114
01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.929
You fuck up your own, so do it,
if you want to do it, do it.

1115
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.761
My name's Carl.

1116
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.327
I'm 19.

1117
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.124
What do you want to do with your life, Carl?

1118
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.561
I do art. I like to draw comics.

1119
01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.927
Then why are you doing this shit?
Don't give up.

1120
01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.129
But if I never get a fucking chance, bruv.

1121
01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.408
Do it independently, just don't do this shit.

1122
01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.925
- He's cool, he's cool.
- Who's cool?

1123
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.809
He's cool, he's cool, he's cool!

1124
01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.527
Me and Carl were just having a conversation.

1125
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.610
My wife does designing.

1126
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.763
If you need anything just message me.

1127
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.606
I'm not him, you know,

1128
01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.444
I don't want to ever see you near me again.

1129
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.365
I hear you're jamming with Daley and Curtis,

1130
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.565
you're gonna get what they get.

1131
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.291
I hear you're around Mooks, you're gonna
get what he gets, you understand me?

1132
01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.242
Bro, that's not a problem.

1133
01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.082
I don't even know Mooks.
Never seen him in my life.

1134
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.924
None of them have seen them.

1135
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.291
Furthermore I'm starting to wonder
if he's even real.

1136
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.091
Did you get what you need?

1137
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.287
Yeah.

1138
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.090
Might need some help on this one though.

1139
01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.001
I swear I heard you call me
a friend in there.

1140
01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.604
No, man, you must be mad.

1141
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.445
- No, I think I did.
- You're smoking.

1142
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:17.647
You're driving.

1143
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.401
Yo.

1144
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.285
I just saw my man...

1145
01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.446
Yeah, yeah, I told him
where the new place is still.

1146
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.410
Listen, you might need to come grab me
though, he's fucked me up a bit.

1147
01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.847
Hugs.

1148
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.084
Everyone get down!

1149
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.761
Move!

1150
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.970
I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.

1151
01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.085
Where's Mooks?

1152
01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.083
Back the fuck up, marmalade.

1153
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.606
Put your head down.

1154
01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.684
Going to fucking shoot you.

1155
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.765
Where's Curtis? Mate, come out.

1156
01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.001
Move.

1157
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.766
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1158
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.131
- Where's Curtis?
- Lock the door. Lock the door.

1159
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.761
Go.

1160
01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.322
Get out! Get out!

1161
01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.163
Where's Curtis?

1162
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.765
- Now, now, get out.
- Head down!

1163
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.282
Where's Mooks? Where's Mooks?

1164
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:25.083
Prick, you think I give a shit about
your fucking muzzle? Huh?

1165
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.003
- Right, where the fuck is that clown?
- I don't know.

1166
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.970
Meet me in my place tonight and bring Curtis,

1167
01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.128
so Mooks can deal with this once and for all.

1168
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.971
And what about Janette?

1169
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.962
Fuck her, there's plenty more of those.

1170
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.165
- Where's Curtis? Where's Curtis?
- Fucking don't...

1171
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.288
Hassan, we've got to go, there's police here,
we've got...

1172
01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.608
- We've got to go, let's go, let's go...
- Go now, go. Go.

1173
01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:50.967
Move.

1174
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.527
I know, mate, it's bad.

1175
01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.003
I thank you for your loyalty, it means a lot.

1176
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.647
Come here.

1177
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.769
Let me in, Daley, Hugs, please, please.

1178
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.128
Please!

1179
01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.004
Sam, I'm so sorry.

1180
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.444
I'm so sorry about your mother.

1181
01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.081
I'm just doing what I'm told,
they promised me...

1182
01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.923
You're called Hugs because you stab people
when you hug them,

1183
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.163
yet you don't want to cuddle.

1184
01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.322
Hope the irony's not lost on you.

1185
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.447
You and that Zulu ain't smarter than me boy.

1186
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.606
Are they, Gary?

1187
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.081
Sam.

1188
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.446
Come on, get here.

1189
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.809
Come on, come on.

1190
01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.806
- Shoot it?
- Yeah.

1191
01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.766
Police, police.
Brick, we have to go, come on.

1192
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.331
- Come on.
- Fuck's sake.

1193
01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.001
- Sam!
- Sariya, hurry up.

1194
01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.007
Come on!

1195
01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.045
- Go!
- No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

1196
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.245
- Where's Sam?
- Go, go, go.

1197
01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.401
Move!

1198
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.088
- OK, drive.
- Mate, fucking go.

1199
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.603
Police! Armed police!

1200
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.087
Down, down, down.

1201
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.845
Armed police, nobody move.

1202
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.128
You didn't get to cut me, did you, bitch?

1203
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.685
Armed police! Police! Clear! Nobody move.

1204
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.370
Armed police. Down on the floor. Down, down.

1205
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.131
Armed police, no one move.

1206
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.323
Ambulance, one male,
with stab wounds to the chest,

1207
01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.084
unconscious, not breathing.

1208
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.601
One detained. I repeat, one detained.

1209
01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.643
We know you weren't there by accident,

1210
01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.087
they're trying to tie you to a few things.

1211
01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.409
The kid you nail-gunned is in hospital,
wants to press charges.

1212
01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.241
The girl you punched, claimed she's a victim
of sex traffic and you're involved.

1213
01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.601
We also acquired some CCTV footage
of the day your mum died.

1214
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.929
They were all on it, with Curtis,

1215
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.251
so at best they think
it's a premeditated revenge attack.

1216
01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.448
I'm the only reason
you're not already in a cell.

1217
01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.408
I know the people that know the people
that can make all of this go away,

1218
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.364
but we want Curtis.

1219
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.285
Daley, Mooks.

1220
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.890
Get me one, or all of them, this disappears.

1221
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.602
Hey, no heroics.

1222
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.650
You know where they are, you call us.

1223
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.930
You might want to think of your family.

1224
01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.290
I am thinking about my family.

1225
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.763
I've known you since we were 11 years old.

1226
01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.122
I'm telling you this as a friend.

1227
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.650
This is your last chance.

1228
01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.247
We done?

1229
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.567
Yo, Hugs, let's get rid of that
fucker Daley, yeah?

1230
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.451
Daley got away and the one
with the knives is dead.

1231
01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.044
So how do you want to do this?

1232
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.763
West London waste ground,

1233
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.607
in one hour.

1234
01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.129
Just you and me.

1235
01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.361
You happy?

1236
01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.401
Not yet.

1237
01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.401
I want you to lose everything
like I lost everything.

1238
01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.090
What the fuck did you lose?

1239
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.921
I lost everything.

1240
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.366
Lexie.

1241
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.404
Kayla's left me, my kids,

1242
01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.409
my brother's leaving, my mum's dead.

1243
01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.130
I lost Trevor.

1244
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.090
And I can't take that back.

1245
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.771
For 16 years I've wished I could.

1246
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.089
If I had one wish, that's all I'd do,
bring back your nephew.

1247
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.726
He was like my son,

1248
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.403
and then you came along.

1249
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.921
The only way you leave here today
is by killing me.

1250
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.451
I'm not doing that.

1251
01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.005
I mean look at us, what are we doing?

1252
01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.287
Two black men just fighting
in the street again.

1253
01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.763
You don't kill me, I'll kill you.

1254
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.405
If you wanted to do it,
why didn't you just do it?

1255
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.245
- Why all of this?
- Because I wanted to earn it!

1256
01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.371
I wanted the bully that killed my Trevor,

1257
01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.769
because if he doesn't get to that gun
before me,

1258
01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.768
after I've killed him
I'm going to kill his family as well.

1259
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.567
Listen, I'm not trying to...

1260
01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.646
Is this what you want?

1261
01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.603
Be careful what you wish for, cuz.

1262
01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.771
Finish me.

1263
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.401
Jeez!

1264
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.769
Stay the fuck away from my family.

1265
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.131
Armed police! Armed police, get down!

1266
01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.769
Secure the weapon, secure the area.

1267
01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.810
Sam, you need to leave right now.

1268
01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.685
I told you to tell us where they were,
not have us follow you around.

1269
01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.921
- Hey.
- You are fucking nicked!

1270
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.088
Hey, we promised, that's enough.

1271
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.201
No, only if he told us where they were.

1272
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.806
- I didn't promise anything.
- Rude boy. Rude boy.

1273
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.246
The commissioner gave us the orders.

1274
01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.441
We know exactly what the role was,

1275
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.762
- we've got our guy.
- I don't care. This is bullshit.

1276
01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.685
- Manor Road...
- Thank you.

1277
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.364
- We don't need to arrest him.
- I'm taking him down.

1278
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.726
I'm taking him down.

1279
01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.291
You're not taking anyone down, all right.

1280
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.923
Come on move, secure the perimeter.

1281
01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.246
Man, this is bullshit.

1282
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.409
Sam, run!

1283
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1284
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.449
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

1285
01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.122
I want to know how you thought you were
gonna get away with this?

1286
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.841
What you think you can have my mom killed,

1287
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.809
you can hurt my brother,
you can threaten my fucking family

1288
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.445
and I'm not going to do nothing?

1289
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.770
Are you dizzy, blud?

1290
01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.721
What?

1291
01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.286
Never mind me.

1292
01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.763
It's just something I used to say.

1293
01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.600
That was all Curtis.

1294
01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.000
I can get you Curtis.

1295
01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.650
He told me how to find you.

1296
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.407
- I can give you money.
- I don't want your fucking money.

1297
01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.091
Then what the fuck do you want?

1298
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.651
Because I've seen your type before, mouth,

1299
01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.404
now you're not going to do anything to me

1300
01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.725
because if you do, you know,
you'll never see your family again.

1301
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.930
So either start talking

1302
01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.891
or get the fuck out of my place
and we'll leave this where it is.

1303
01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.200
You're right.

1304
01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.250
I'm not going to do anything.

1305
01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.203
Even though I want to,
even after everything you did,

1306
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.442
because you know what,
I love what I have too much to risk it.

1307
01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.730
You know what?

1308
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.050
Not everyone's like me.

1309
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.241
Hey, Daley.

1310
01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.963
Or should I call you Mooks?

1311
01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.091
You're so fucked.

1312
01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.401
Mum.

1313
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.601
Daddy!

1314
01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.440
Would you like anything else?

1315
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.890
Just the bill please.

1316
01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.365
So look, um...

1317
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.651
I'm not perfect.

1318
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.251
I'm just...

1319
01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.248
You know, I'm just one of those guys.

1320
01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.603
I'm not going to fuck us up again.

1321
01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.408
I just need to know that you're my guy.

1322
01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.125
If I know that,
I'll ride for you every step of the way.

1323
01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.723
There's nothing more important to me
than you and the kids.

1324
01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.247
Nothing.

1325
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.606
And so all of the drama,

1326
01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.081
is it done?

1327
01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.969
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

1328
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.969
- Daddy, funny.
- Let's go.

1329
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.245
Ah, man.

1330
01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.761
OK, go listen to this guy.
Go, go, let's go...

1331
01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.361
Sam.

1332
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.242
Just cleaning up some last little bits.

1333
01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.049
So this isn't a coincidence, is it?

1334
01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.805
No, no coincidence.

1335
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.411
I knew you were here.

1336
01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.123
So what, are you here to take me in,
in front of my family?

1337
01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.762
I'm standing here after all these years
and I'm thinking about where our lives are,

1338
01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.562
and I'm thinking about how things seemed
so much bigger when we were young,

1339
01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.048
yet by actually doing this job

1340
01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.610
I see it meant nothing.

1341
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.640
That...

1342
01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.129
That's all that means anything.

1343
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.405
You're free to go.

1344
01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.082
I make a promise, I keep it.

1345
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.408
Friends or not, you will not be getting
any more chances from me,

1346
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.925
do you understand?

1347
01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.449
I don't want to see you again...

1348
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.965
Unless,

1349
01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.567
Kayla makes that apple crumble
for my birthday, I wouldn't miss that.

1350
01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.401
Be good.

1351
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.283
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1352
01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.087
Yeah, babe.

1353
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.407
Yeah.

1354
01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.767
It's done.
