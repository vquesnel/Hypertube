<i> Previously on</i>
The Expanse...

2
00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:11.076
Show me incident
reports for the docks for
Juliette Andromeda Mao.

3
00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.412
Hold it right there.

4
00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.583
How much are they
paying you to find her?

5
00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:19.018
Come on,
Gia's down there.
What?

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.652
She kind of needs
us here, pal.

7
00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.288
You want to take it?
Go.
Yeah, all right.

8
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.258
No...

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.393
Remember the <i> Cant?</i>

10
00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.395
You're an OPA terrorist.

11
00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:31.530
You were carrying contraband
stealth technology.

12
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:33.665
<i> What was it for?</i>

13
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.667
Get those sensors pointed
toward the <i> Donnager.</i>

14
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.403
I need a full report.

15
00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:39.605
But judging by the file names,
these are government records.

16
00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:41.607
Okay.
This guy was
a data broker.

17
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.542
Well, whatever he brokered,

18
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.077

<i> Dr. Omari to Intake.</i>

23
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.620
You're an idiot.

24
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.689
Nice
to see you too,
Miller.

25
00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:38.464
Havelock,
you don't listen.

26
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.401
I told you.

27
00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:45.771
I said,
keep your head down,
keep your eyes open.

28
00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.308
Especially
in the Medina.

29
00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.144
I told you
I was going there
to...

30
00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:01.687
Please tell me this is
just a get-well present
for yourself?

31
00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.523
Please, put it
on my tab, huh?

32
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.692
You don't know
what you're talking about,
Miller.

33
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:08.760
She's been
teaching me.

34
00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:10.262
I'm getting
pretty good, too.

35
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.566
<i> Ka na te nada,</i>
<i> Dmitri...</i>

36
00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.236
You think all this
is gonna help you?

37
00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:19.605
Man, the next spike's
gonna go right through
your skull.

38
00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:22.241
Yeah, coming from
a real fountain
of police wisdom.

39
00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:25.744
You know, look the other way,
take your bribe,
do as little as possible.

40
00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.447
Hey, you see
any extra holes in me,
pal?

41
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.716
'Im was brave for
come check on me.

42
00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:33.318
Other police
no come down to
the <i> Rosse Buurt.</i>

43
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.553
Come on.

44
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.856
You think
she cares about you?

45
00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.791
What's the name
of the scumbag

46
00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.361
that paid you
to lure him down
to the Medina,

47
00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:44.163
so they could
jam up a cop?

48
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:45.631
<i> Pashang fong,</i>
<i> zakomang.</i>

49
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:47.399
Oh, and me
without my wallet.

50
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.433
Too bad.

51
00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.471
You put your hands
on her again

52
00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.675
and you see how fast
I get out of this bed,
Miller.

53
00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:25.904
Oh!

54
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.391
Look who's up.

55
00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:52.331
Did you
get enough sleep,
Princess?

56
00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.932
Come here and help me.

57
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:04.977
Do you know
what you're doing?

58
00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.012
I fix ships,
not people.

59
00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.781
God damn it!
Just hold him
still.

60
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.429
Where's Alex?

61
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.031
I'm comin',
I'm comin'.

62
00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:29.001
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, patch him up.

63
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:30.902
I'm not Shed,
I don't know
what I'm doing.

64
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.338
Neither did he.
Just give him
the shot.

65
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.807
Which one do I use first?
The antisep' or the...

66
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.677
That solves that.

67
00:04:56.297 --> 00:04:57.763
Good as new.

68
00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:58.864
Whatever you say,
boss.

69
00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:00.465
What's our status?

70
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.468
Oh, hoss. She is one
beautiful lady.

71
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.337
She purrs
like a kitty
at 12 Gs.

72
00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.872
No, no, no, no.

73
00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:10.542
Is anybody
following us?
No, sir.
Scope's clear.

74
00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:11.943
I shut down
the drive and
the transponder

75
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.979
as soon as
we'd cleared
the debris field.

76
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:16.715
And right now,
we're just a tumbleweedin'
piece of scrap metal.

77
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.685
So, as far as we know,
nobody made it off
the <i> Donnager...</i>

78
00:05:19.687 --> 00:05:21.553
That's correct.

79
00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:24.856
And no one knows
that we're alive?
That's right.

80
00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.460
Then who
just sent us a message?

81
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.608
<i> Belu</i> is
your favorite color.

82
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.443
Try that one
first.

83
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.644
<i> Uh-oh.</i>

84
00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.613
Oh.

85
00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.515
That's okay,
Hinekiri.

86
00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.117
Try again.
You can do it.

87
00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.420
<i> Try again.</i>

88
00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:29.888
<i> That's a match.</i>

89
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.490
<i> You ta ge im.</i>

90
00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.893
<i> Vedi.</i>
<i> Vedi ere wango.</i>

91
00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.569
<i> Kom wango.</i>

92
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.938
You keep
practicing.

93
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.078
<i> Try again.</i>

94
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.663
This is
Anderson Station.

95
00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.632
Go ahead.

96
00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:16.034
<i> Anderson Station,</i>
<i> this is UN1.</i>

97
00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:18.069
<i> Are you ready</i>
<i> to surrender?</i>

98
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.013
<i> Survivors</i>
<i> of the</i> Donnager,

99
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.881
<i> my name is</i>
<i> Fred Johnson,</i>

100
00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:33.018
<i> Director of Operations</i>
<i> at Tycho Station.</i>

101
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.219
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> who you are,</i>

102
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.054
<i> or what your intent</i>
<i> may be,</i>

103
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.023
<i> but unless you're trying</i>
<i> to start a war,</i>

104
00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:39.691
<i> you need</i>
<i> to contact me.</i>

105
00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.760
<i> I can help you.</i>

106
00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:43.728
He shouldn't have been able
to track us.

107
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.030
But he did.

108
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.501
Hey, isn't he some kinda
big-shot for the OPA?

109
00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.837
Yeah,
what does it matter?

110
00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.139
He offered us
help.

111
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.941
We have to go
somewhere.

112
00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:59.077
Well, I say we fly
to the nearest Mars base
and turn ourselves in.

113
00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.645
That's
an excellent idea.

114
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.682
We'll just roll up
in a stolen
Mickey Corvette,

115
00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:06.017
with a dead Martian
in the trunk.

116
00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.152
I'm sure
they'll roll out
the red carpet.

117
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:08.620
Hey, smartass.

118
00:08:08.622 --> 00:08:10.655
A lot of
good Martians died
saving our lives,

119
00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:11.990
so we get
the truth out.

120
00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.859
The comms
on the <i> Donnager</i>
were jammed

121
00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.494
during the attack.

122
00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:17.529
The only Martians
who'd believe us
are dead.

123
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:19.898
So, let's just
burn hard to Ceres

124
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.666
and we'll take
our chances.

125
00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.902
No port
is going to let us dock
with our transponder off.

126
00:08:23.904 --> 00:08:25.270
And the minute
we turn it on,

127
00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:28.773
every Martian ship
in the system
will know it.

128
00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.909
Think about it,

129
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:34.045
we're the only survivors
from the <i> Canterbury</i>
and the <i> Donnager.</i>

130
00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:37.249
We look like
terrorists.

131
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:40.185
No one's gonna
believe our story.
I wouldn't believe us.

132
00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:43.188
Fred Johnson
just offered us
a lifeline.

133
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.657
I say we take it.

134
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.659
We're not going
to Tycho.

135
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.531
You got
any other ideas?

136
00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:55.267
You can't trust
Fred Johnson.

137
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.035
We all know
what he's capable of.

138
00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.771
That was, like,
10 years ago.
People change.

139
00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:02.807
The Martians said
you were OPA.

140
00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:05.310
Stop talking
about stuff that you
know nothing about,

141
00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:06.778
because...

142
00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:10.048
I vote "no."

143
00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:16.922
Holden's got a point.

144
00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:18.323
We gotta go
somewhere.

145
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.296
Amos?

146
00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.266
I'm with you,
boss.

147
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:30.735
Then it's two
against two.

148
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.771
We're not going
anywhere.

149
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.053
Heard it was
Golden Bough that
took out the <i> Donnager.</i>

150
00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:49.821
OPA's got
gunships now, too.

151
00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:51.823
Things just
getting started.

152
00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:54.059
Dirtsiders
won't pay us no mind,
unless we make them.

153
00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:05.136
Star Helix, guys.
Just calm down,
okay?

154
00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:07.639
The power
will be back on
in a minute.

155
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.608
Course it is.

156
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.077
No Earther's pet
gonna tell me to calm down.

157
00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:19.884
<i> It's over, cop...</i>

158
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.224
Hey,
what're you doing?
Are you crazy?

159
00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:29.327
He don't
deserve to breathe
the Belter folks' air.

160
00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:32.330
Watch your eyes, cop.

161
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.336
I wanna kill that guy.

162
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.941
<i> Remember the</i> Cant?

163
00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.976
His name's
Filat Kothari,

164
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.411
Loca Greiga muscle.

165
00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.813
Sayonara, <i> Ceres,</i>

166
00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.016
<i> that's my</i>
<i> going-away present</i>
<i> to you!</i>

167
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.952
<i> Onto bigger</i>
<i> and better things.</i>

168
00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:57.956
It was posted
a couple minutes ago.
It's everywhere.

169
00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.324
Does Miller know yet?

170
00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:01.226
He didn't show
today.

171
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:09.934
Anubis...

172
00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:15.073
Show me this, uh, ship's
flight path.

173
00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:23.048
Show me...

174
00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.682
Julie's
projected flight path
for the <i> Scopuli.</i>

175
00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:27.085
Go 3D.

176
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.335
In the wake of
the riots,

177
00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:44.969
the Governor's orders
were to proceed
with extreme caution

178
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.439
when dealing
with any known
OPA members...

179
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:50.809
Luckily,
this asshole's
not OPA.

180
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.944
So, if he resists,
take him out.

181
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:54.446
If he runs,
shoot him.

182
00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:57.348
And if
he accidentally
falls out an airlock,

183
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.085
that's life.

184
00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:03.722
Havelock is one of us.
This is still our station.

185
00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.725
Let's make sure
that people don't
think otherwise.

186
00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.364
Semi.
Long time, partner.

187
00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:14.933
Listen,
I need a favor.

188
00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:17.268
I need you to run down
a transponder code for me,
okay?

189
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.871
It's for a ship
called the <i> "Anubus,"</i>
or, <i> "Anubis."</i>

190
00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:24.943
I'm going to spell it.
A-N-U-B-I-S.

191
00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:27.078
Thanks, buddy,
I owe you one.

192
00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.348
Or, are we even?

193
00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.427
What're you
doing here?

194
00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.295
Could ask you
the same thing.
Oh...

195
00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:45.864
Figured
you'd be out
hunting down

196
00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.966
the guy
who jacked up
your partner.

197
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:51.136
Yeah, yeah,
I'm just finishing up
a few things, um...

198
00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:54.506
What's that smell?

199
00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.141
It's called, uh, coffee.

200
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.942
That's what I mean.

201
00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.814
Since when
do you drink coffee?

202
00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:10.922
Have you seen
the footage of
Havelock and Kothari?

203
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.159
Planning on doing
anything about it?

204
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.094
Yeah.

205
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.862
I was planning on
hunting the guy down
and killing him.

206
00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:19.164
Real slow.

207
00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:22.400
Where's the guy
going to go?

208
00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:32.977
Oh.

209
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.813
Right after
you find your
little rich girl,

210
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.115
shake down her daddy
for a big payday.

211
00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:40.051
Yeah, that's it.
You got me.

212
00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.821
All right. Well, Miller.
I'll, I'll leave you to it.

213
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.327
You know, everything
going on out there,

214
00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.062
all this shitstorm
that we're in,

215
00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.464
it's all got to do
with her.

216
00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:54.966
Julie Mao.

217
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.370
Okay.
I'm listening.

218
00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:00.538
You know
that memory crypt

219
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.173
that we took out
of that stiff?

220
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.242
Yeah?
All right.
Go 3D.

221
00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.344
It had
an unregistered
flight path

222
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.447
for a ship
called the <i> Anubis,</i>
<i> Anubis.</i>

223
00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:12.517
The Anubis left
Phoebe Research Station,

224
00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.954
and it was
headed for Eros,
okay?

225
00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.389
Now, I'm thinking,

226
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.627
"Hmm,
maybe something's being
transported on this ship."

227
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:27.932
I'm thinking,
"Julie's ship was sent out
to intercept it."

228
00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:30.368
And then, suddenly,

229
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.503
ships start blowing up,
the <i> Canterbury,</i>
the <i> Donnager,</i>

230
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.107
it's got to be
connected.

231
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:38.576
Does Shaddid know
about any of this?

232
00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:41.246
I told her
about Julie, I told her
about the <i> Scopuli.</i>

233
00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:43.414
I don't know,
she didn't bite.

234
00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:45.483
I need more...

235
00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:48.386
I need more pieces
to the puzzle.

236
00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.256
What do you think
is on this <i> "Anubis"</i> ?

237
00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.592
Something.

238
00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:57.262
Something worth
spilling a lot of blood
over.

239
00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:58.496
Miller,

240
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.334
maybe this is
above your pay-grade.

241
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.075
You don't think
I can do it, huh?

242
00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:15.113
You don't think
I can crack the case?

243
00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:18.283
No, I mean,
you need to take this
upstairs.

244
00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.452
Yeah, well, maybe.

245
00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.522
Until then,
I'll just, uh...

246
00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:26.958
I guess I'll do
my pathetic best.

247
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:44.759
.

248
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.575
<i>Yeah we hear you loud and clear</i>
<i> UN1</i>

249
00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:48.146
<i> but we don't think</i>
<i> that you're hearing us.</i>

250
00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.381
The terms we've outlined
are clear and simple,

251
00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:55.453
and until they're met,
we're not giving up
control of this station.

252
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.655
We want to negotiate
peacefully...

253
00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.424
<i> Mr. Marama, I need you</i>
<i> to listen very carefully.</i>

254
00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:01.392
<i> We will not</i>
<i> listen to threats.</i>

255
00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:03.261
<i> We do not negotiate</i>
<i> with terrorists.</i>

256
00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.729
<i> Is that clear?</i>
Yes, I understand.

257
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:08.199
<i> Think about your children.</i>
<i> UN Command out.</i>

258
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:10.101
Anderson Station out.

259
00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:18.309
We've taken this
as far as we can.

260
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.677
Aw, the hell
we have!

261
00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.212
It's only been
a few days.

262
00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:23.014
They're
not going to attack
a bunch of civilians.

263
00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:24.148
They're calling us
terrorists.

264
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.284
Of course
they are!

265
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.987
Gero, we need
to surrender now.

266
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.655
I'll take charge
if you're losing
your nerve.

267
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.223
You can't
tell us to stop.

268
00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:33.758
You don't speak
for all of us.

269
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.694
We voted together,
and we're all
in this together.

270
00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:38.363
We're not
giving up on this.

271
00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:40.198
We should've dumped
a few more <i> bosmain</i>
into space,

272
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.299
when we had
the chance.

273
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:44.002
The station manager
was an accident.

274
00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.238
Is that
the kind of people
we are now?

275
00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:48.473
No, that's
the kind of people
they made us.

276
00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.375
We have to
fight back.

277
00:16:50.377 --> 00:16:51.509
With what?

278
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.278
We're not soldiers.

279
00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.750
If we surrender now,

280
00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:01.686
it's as good as
killing our own children.

281
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.455
What the hell
was that?

282
00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:06.024
They've taken out
the generators!

283
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.092
Don't be scared,
okay?

284
00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:09.527
Shh, shh, shh.

285
00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:01.145
You know
I'm an engineer?

286
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.517
Show me
drive diagnostics
and core levels.

287
00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:09.420
Life support.

288
00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:18.463
What's going on?

289
00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.865
Oh, I don't know,
ask the ship,

290
00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:23.634
it seems
to know everything.

291
00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:26.404
It sure beats
the buckets that we've
been on in the past.

292
00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.207
There's nothing to fix.
You fixed my leg.

293
00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:34.345
Why not go to Tycho,
if we got nowhere else
to go?

294
00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:36.414
It's a long story.

295
00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:43.421
I always back your play
because you always
do the right thing.

296
00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:45.156
But usually,
I can figure out why.

297
00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:47.158
It's not the place.
It's the man.

298
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.161
Fred Johnson?
You know him?

299
00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:52.497
I've known guys
like him.

300
00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.798
Guys with causes.

301
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.700
Causes that
get people killed.

302
00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:00.571
So where
should we go?

303
00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:39.911
Tell Fred Johnson
to clear us a berth.
We're good to go.

304
00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:41.812
You talked Naomi
into it?

305
00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:45.449
With our track record,
we'll probably get Tycho
blown to smithereens, too.

306
00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:51.322
Run through the files
on the dock incident.

307
00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.292
Slow down. Mmm.

308
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:57.695
Give me a better look
at the people.

309
00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:01.699
Now hold it there.

310
00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:06.837
Stop.

311
00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:09.640
You knew him.

312
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:11.842
Identify that man.

313
00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:21.352
Dark rum,
Javier.

314
00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:23.854
And, uh, whatever
the detective's
drinking.

315
00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.556
Right away,
Mr. Dawes.

316
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.558
Nothing for me.

317
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.427
Strange times,
indeed.

318
00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:32.730
Call it
a conflict
of interest.

319
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:37.401
Whatever gets you
through the day,
<i> beratna.</i>

320
00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.370
To keeping
the peace...

321
00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:46.577
You know,
the holding cells
are full of OPA tats.

322
00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:50.481
Street trash
and radical factions
are not OPA,

323
00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:53.451
despite
what their skin
tells you.

324
00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.785
Good answer.

325
00:20:57.323 --> 00:20:58.990
I'm sorry
about your partner.

326
00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:01.459
An appalling
injustice.

327
00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.527
And I assure you,

328
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:07.465
the piece of trash
who tried to crucify him
is not one of our ranks.

329
00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:13.004
What's worse,
he's not even
remorseful.

330
00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.912
How would
you know that?

331
00:21:21.914 --> 00:21:23.581
Because,
as we speak,

332
00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:25.983
he's in
an OPA safe house.

333
00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:29.954
He believes
he's under
my protection.

334
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.728
Open your eyes,
Detective. Look around.

335
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.896
They're as open
as I can manage.

336
00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:40.998
Yet, you don't see
what I see.

337
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.634
What do you see?

338
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.438
A Ceres for Belters.
Run by Belters.

339
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:49.807
Run by you?

340
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:50.941
If I live that long.

341
00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:55.313
Right now, the OPA
controls most of the grids.

342
00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:56.714
Air, power, water...

343
00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:59.483
The very lifeblood
of the station.

344
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:02.687
And if the Earthers
don't play nice...

345
00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:04.455
All we've ever known

346
00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:08.326
is low-g
and an atmosphere
we can't breathe.

347
00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:11.929
Earthers get to walk
outside into the light,

348
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:16.634
breathe pure air,

349
00:22:16.636 --> 00:22:21.605
look up at a blue
sky, and see something
that gives them hope.

350
00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:24.475
And what do they do?

351
00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:29.046
They look past that light...
Past that blue sky...

352
00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:34.752
They see the stars,
and they think, "Mine."

353
00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:39.056
What's your point?

354
00:22:40.927 --> 00:22:43.127
Earthers have a home.

355
00:22:44.097 --> 00:22:47.765
It's time Belters
had one, too.

356
00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:51.836
It's important we
don't get distracted
from that goal...

357
00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:05.583
There's a single
contact in that unit.

358
00:23:05.585 --> 00:23:10.821
Call it, and you'll get
Filat Kothari's location.

359
00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:16.827
He's yours, to do whatever
you think is right to...

360
00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:20.631
Sounds like a bribe.

361
00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:22.600
I haven't asked
you for anything.

362
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.638
Yet. What do you want?

363
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.175
A simple exchange
of information.

364
00:23:34.547 --> 00:23:37.882
Julie Mao was one of ours.

365
00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:42.019
I want to find out
what happened to her
just as much as you do.

366
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.495
You think a man
like Filat Kothari
deserves to walk free?

367
00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:54.498
Because he will.

368
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.933
Far away from here.

369
00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:58.202
Nobody wants that.

370
00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:06.444
Go get your justice, Miller.

371
00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:09.713
Make it pretty.

372
00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:13.784
Let's do this
again real soon.

373
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:37.725
They're done talking.

374
00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.643
Have they been jamming
our communications
this whole time?

375
00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.880
The only patch we
have is the tight-beam
to their negotiator.

376
00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:45.516
So, no one outside
of the station knows
this is happening?

377
00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:47.251
That's why we
need to surrender.

378
00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:52.890
Do it.

379
00:24:54.694 --> 00:24:55.893
We're surrendering
to the Marines.

380
00:24:55.895 --> 00:24:57.495
No.

381
00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:01.165
We did everything we could...

382
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:05.936
Hinekiri, show Daddy
how smart you are, okay?

383
00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:07.738
Okay.

384
00:25:17.817 --> 00:25:21.051
UN Command, this
is Anderson Station.

385
00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:25.022
We're issuing our
unconditional surrender.

386
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:27.525
We're unarmed.
We have women
and children with us.

387
00:25:28.094 --> 00:25:29.260
Copy?

388
00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:32.763
I repeat, we surrender.

389
00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:35.866
UN 1, please respond.

390
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.547
<i> Emergency in</i>
<i> the Belt as Ceres Station</i>

391

402
00:26:22.882 --> 00:26:25.182
Looks like we're
not the only ones
who remember the <i> Cant.</i>

403
00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:27.184
<i> Retaliation for what some</i>

405
00:26:29.589 --> 00:26:31.655
What the hell?

406
00:26:31.657 --> 00:26:32.890
It can't be...

407
00:26:36.295 --> 00:26:37.761
What's up?

408
00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:42.199
Hey, um...

409
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:46.136
I just hooked into a feed
from Ganymede and uh...

410
00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:48.105
Hey, when you sent that
message to Fred Johnson,

411
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:51.775
you didn't give him our
names or anything, did you?

412
00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:53.043
No, of course not.

413
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:59.216
Well, partner, it's gonna
be kinda hard for you
to stay anonymous now.

414
00:27:02.922 --> 00:27:05.789
Let me know if you
want your face to
look a little different.

415
00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:15.332
<i> Attention. Any ships</i>
<i> without Earth or Mars</i>

416
00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:20.638
<i> issued DC-14 clearance</i>
<i> must submit to</i>
<i> inspection upon arrival.</i>

417
00:27:53.973 --> 00:27:56.740
Julie Mao. You know her.

418
00:27:56.742 --> 00:28:00.210
You never asked a girl down at
the docks if she was looking
for some drilling work?

419
00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:03.681
That's the last stupid
thing you get to say to
me during this interview.

420
00:28:05.418 --> 00:28:09.086
Julie Mao chartered my
ship, but that was a couple
of years ago. It was nothing.

421
00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:14.692
Why? Why would she charter
a piece of shit like this?

422
00:28:14.694 --> 00:28:18.362
She wanted to tour the
Belt. Figured her for
a dirtsider, slumming.

423
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:21.331
Flirting with the OPA,
sticking it to her old man

424
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.200
at the same time...
You were trying
to recruit her...

425
00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:25.903
My days of giving
a damn are long gone, pal.

426
00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:28.839
OPA throws me work
from time to time.

427
00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:30.741
Happy to wear their
tat, take their money.

428
00:28:30.743 --> 00:28:33.177
Happy to take Julie
Mao's money, too, huh?

429
00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:36.847
Babe in the woods,
long way from home...

430
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:39.817
You're as wrong
about her as I was.

431
00:28:40.786 --> 00:28:42.019
Yeah?

432
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.225
A month into the trip,
we stopped over at
the mines on Callisto.

433
00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:52.496
News was that
a tunnel collapse had
torn open veins of cadmium,

434
00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:55.899
and people were
dying from the vapors.

435
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:59.069
After two days down at
the aid camp, I begged
Julie to get out of there.

436
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:01.972
But she said she was okay.
She said she felt safe.

437
00:29:01.974 --> 00:29:03.774
She stayed down in the mines,

438
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:05.809
breathing the same poisoned
air as those Belters,

439
00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:07.478
eating the same
contaminated food.

440
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.881
She was helping kids
who'd lost their parents,

441
00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:14.084
folks who were choking on
the blood in their lungs.

442
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:16.820
I never saw her shed a tear
over the fact that she had

443
00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:19.089
to take anti-cancer meds
for the rest of her life...

444
00:29:23.028 --> 00:29:25.763
Only time I did
see her cry was, uh...

445
00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:29.233
These Belters
at a rally,

446
00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:32.469
they told her,
"You're one of us now."

447
00:29:32.471 --> 00:29:33.937
You admired her.

448
00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:38.475
And how long were you
sleeping with her?

449
00:29:38.477 --> 00:29:40.377
Is that what you came
here to find out?

450
00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:42.446
I'm done talking
to you, badge.

451
00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:44.815
You can take it out on
me if you want to, but...

452
00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:47.351
The <i> Scopuli.</i>

453
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.158
You know, that ship
that started that
whole mess out there?

454
00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:56.827
Julie was on it.

455
00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:00.998
Jesus... Jesus Christ.

456
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:07.271
You were trying to
stop her from getting
involved in something ugly.

457
00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:08.972
I want to know what it was.

458
00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:16.113
She was hanging around
some hardcore OPA.

459
00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:17.514
Like?

460
00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:19.483
Anderson Dawes.

461
00:30:21.587 --> 00:30:23.086
What for?

462
00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:24.188
I don't know.

463
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.989
A few weeks
before she shipped out,

464
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:27.457
she asked me
to hook her up
with a data broker.

465
00:30:31.897 --> 00:30:33.030
This guy.

466
00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:35.065
Where can I find him?

467
00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:37.835
I don't know.

468
00:30:37.837 --> 00:30:39.169
Where does he work out of?

469
00:30:40.239 --> 00:30:43.407
Come on! He'd...
He'd kill me
if I told you.

470
00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:45.242
I just saw him
at the morgue.

471
00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:46.910
He's on his way
to the recycler.

472
00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:49.546
He's mushroom food.

473
00:30:53.052 --> 00:30:54.518
You want to join him?

474
00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:59.890
Tech Noir, Level 14.

475
00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:02.059
Ask the clerk
for a Sherpa.

476
00:31:02.061 --> 00:31:03.594
Sherpa?
Yeah.

477
00:31:05.464 --> 00:31:06.897
Do you think Julie's dead?

478
00:31:08.901 --> 00:31:11.235
You should've stopped her.

479
00:31:11.237 --> 00:31:14.371
Nobody could stop Julie
from doing anything
she wanted to do.

480
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:16.073
You should've protected her.

481
00:31:16.609 --> 00:31:18.442
But you didn't.

482
00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:22.112
She still got
on that ship, huh?

483
00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:23.580
You don't understand Julie.

484
00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:26.583
She went out there,
and probably got
herself killed

485
00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:30.420
over some stupid cause
she barely understood anyway.

486
00:32:05.691 --> 00:32:07.341
.

487
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:08.992
We surrender, do you copy?

488
00:32:08.994 --> 00:32:11.528
UN Command,
we surrender.
Do you copy?

489
00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:15.332
Everyone's ready.

490
00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:16.533
They're not listening.

491
00:32:18.237 --> 00:32:19.670
What do you mean?

492
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.039
<i> Imalowda na</i> listening!

493
00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:24.541
What do we do?

494
00:32:26.245 --> 00:32:28.078
What do we do?

495
00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:49.166
No.

496
00:32:50.202 --> 00:32:52.302
No. If we have a voice,

497
00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:54.671
we can still be heard.

498
00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:56.606
How?
There's an auxiliary

499
00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:59.042
tight-beam transmitter
mounted on Toro 5.

500
00:32:59.044 --> 00:33:00.544
I think it's just outside
their jamming range.

501
00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:04.047
I should be able
to relay the station's
camera footage

502
00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:06.183
and broadcast out.

503
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.427
<i> My name is Marama Brown.</i>

504
00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:20.597
Four days ago,
the miners working for the
Anderson-Hyosung Corporation

505
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:24.601
took control of this station,
in an effort to protest the
treatment of our children.

506
00:33:27.439 --> 00:33:28.672
<i> Sitara mali.</i>

507
00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:34.745
This is my daughter, Kiri.

508
00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:38.115
She and, uh...

509
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.122
She and the other children
have been diagnosed with
what the medics are calling

510
00:33:46.425 --> 00:33:49.359
hypoxic brain injury.

511
00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.429
It's due to the low-oxygen
working environments.

512
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.799
<i> She got it</i>
<i> when she came</i>
<i> to live here with me.</i>

513
00:33:55.801 --> 00:33:58.735
<i> But the company</i>
<i> is refusing us</i>
<i> medical assistance,</i>

514
00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:01.671
<i> and they're denying</i>
<i> that a problem even exists.</i>

515
00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:04.541
We're not a violent people.

516
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:08.545
We didn't intend
for anyone to be hurt
during our protests,

517
00:34:08.547 --> 00:34:10.313
and for that, we...

518
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.150
And for that, I am sorry.

519
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.522
We have tried repeatedly
to surrender to
the UN Marines. But...

520
00:34:22.528 --> 00:34:26.363
We just wanted to be heard
for the sake of our children.

521
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:13.376
<i> Anderson Station</i>
<i> is secure. All terrorists</i>
<i> have been subdued.</i>

522
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:20.183
<i> Well done, Colonel. Well done.</i>

523
00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:38.235
<i> You have my</i>
<i> solemn promise that</i>
<i> you will not be harmed.</i>

524
00:35:38.237 --> 00:35:41.438
<i> And you will be granted</i>
<i> safe harbor on Tycho.</i>

525
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.540
<i> Since you've chosen</i>
<i> to remain anonymous,</i>

526
00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:46.576
<i> I can only hope you</i>
<i> have no hostile intent.</i>

527
00:35:46.578 --> 00:35:52.449
<i> Regardless, you will need to</i>
<i> change your transponder code</i>
<i> in order to avoid detection.</i>

528
00:35:52.451 --> 00:35:55.318
<i> The instructions are</i>
<i> embedded in this message.</i>

529
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.589
<i> Do not deviate from them</i>
<i> in any way. Safe journey.</i>

530
00:36:12.471 --> 00:36:13.904
Have you done this before?

531
00:36:13.906 --> 00:36:16.173
Yeah, about once a week.

532
00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:17.541
Well, you're doing great.

533
00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:24.714
Transponders are designed
not to be tampered with.

534
00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:26.850
Civilian models fuse
themselves into lumps

535
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:29.519
of molten graphene if
they get messed with.

536
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:31.821
We could be a supernova
a few seconds from now.

537
00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:34.658
Well, we won't have to
worry about Tycho, will we?

538
00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.834
We need to give
the ship a new name
to complete the override.

539
00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:47.437
<i> Screamin' Firehawk.</i>

540
00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:49.973
Yeah, let's advertise
that we're a gun ship.

541
00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:51.741
<i> Flying Alamo.</i>

542
00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:54.277
No.
Give me something,
please.

543
00:36:57.783 --> 00:36:59.216
<i> Rocinante.</i>

544
00:36:59.218 --> 00:37:00.350
Huh?

545
00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:01.484
It's Spanish, for...

546
00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:03.520
Workhorse.

547
00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:06.356
I like it.
I knew a lady
named Rocinante.

548
00:37:06.358 --> 00:37:07.591
She was good to me.

549
00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:10.627
Whatever. Punch it.

550
00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:16.326
How many times
do I have to tell you
I don't want any?

551
00:38:19.765 --> 00:38:20.997
Yeah, we're good.
That's good.

552
00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:32.309
What you need,
Mister Star Helix?

553
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:35.745
Runnin' a special on some
fine new digital duster
sims we just got in stock.

554
00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:37.881
<i> Inners of the Inners 9 & 10.</i>

<i> Na sasas...</i>

559
00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:59.469
you come back here,
tell this dude he's got
a customer. Is that right?

560
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:01.871
Yeah. Him worked back
here. That's all I know.

561
00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:03.473
Okay, go.
