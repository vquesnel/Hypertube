Yeah, yeah. No Stella.
(LAUGHING)

1793
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.684
Am I still sending
all the bills
to Baroness Lublubliana...

1794
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.321
Rothschild Von Thy...

1795
01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.006
Mum, no!
You can't do that.

1796
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.010
No, Eddy, no, no, no.

1797
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.727
Think of our life, our dream!

1798
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.764
Don't let this repellent little shrew

1799
01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.604
take it away from us.

1800
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.569
Every time our life hits a good patch,

1801
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.325
this miserable piece of flesh ruins it.

1802
01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.722
If you don't tell her, I will!

1803
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.489
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

1804
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.722
No!

1805
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.041
(SIGHS)

1806
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.087
Lubey, I have something to tell you.

1807
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.771
I'm not a man.

1808
01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.485
I know.

1809
01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.042
And I'm not a woman.

1810
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.525
EDINA: Well, you don't mind
sleeping with him/her?

1811
01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.086
Does it mean
you don't need the strap-on?
I don't know.

1812
01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.490
(THlS WHEEL'S ON FlRE BY KYLIE MINOGUE)

1813
01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.526
Wheel's on fire

1814
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.966
Rolling down the road

1815
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.049
Best notify my next ofkin

1816
01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.560
This wheel shall explode!

1817
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.927
If your memory serves you well

1818
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.764
I was going to confiscate my lace

1819
01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.927
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot

1820
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.930
And hide it in your case

1821
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.004
If I knew for sure that it was yours

1822
01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.567
But it was oh, so hard to tell

1823
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.206
But you knew that we would meet again

1824
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.125
lfyour memory served you well

1825
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.166
Wheel's on fire

1826
01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:03.483
Rolling down the road

Best notify my next ofkin

1828
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.485
This wheel shall explode!

1829
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.885
If your memory serves you well

1830
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.644
You'll remember you're the one

1831
01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.488
That called on me to call on them

1832
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.645
To get you your favors done

1833
01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.804
And after every plan had failed

1834
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.003
And there was nothing more to tell

1835
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.920
You knew that we would meet again

1836
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.163
lfyour memory served you well

1837

Wheel's on fire

1838
01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.244
Rolling down the road

1839
01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.730
Best notify my next ofkin

1840
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.883
This wheel shall explode!

1841
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.331
You talk like Marlene Dietrich

1842
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.602
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire

1843
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.762
Your clothes are all made by Balmain

1844
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.568
And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair

1845
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.641
Yes, there are

1846
01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.888
You live in a fancy apartment

1847
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.849
Off
the Boulevard Saint-Michel

1848
01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.771
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records

1849
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.730
And your friend of Sacha Distel

1850
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.801
Yes, you do

1851
01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.328
Oh, but where do you go to, my lovely

1852
01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.291
When you're alone in your bed?

1853
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.963
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

1854
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.371
I want to look inside your head

1855
01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.641
Yes, I do

1856
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.008
I've seen all your qualifications

1857
01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.082
You got from the Sorbonne

1858
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.849
And the painting you stole from Picasso

1859
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.004
Your loveliness goes on and on

1860
01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.161
Yes, it does

1861
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.289
Oh, when you go on your summer vacation

1862
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.130
You go to Juan-les-Pins

1863
01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.801
With your carefully designed
topless swimsuit

1864
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.409
You get an even suntan

1865
01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.842
On your back and on your legs

1866
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.887
And when the snow falls
you're found in St. Moritz

1867
01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.763
With the others of thejet-set

1868
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.081
And you sip your Napoleon brandy

1869
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.685
But you never get your lips wet

1870
01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.000
No, you don't

1871
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.811
But where do you go to my lovely

1872
01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.443
When you're alone in your bed?

1873
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.329
Won't you
tell me the thoughts
that surround you?

1874
01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.284
I want to look inside your head

1875
01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.361
Yes, I do

1876
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.483
Your name it is heard in high places

1877
01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.802
You know the Aga Khan

1878
01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.808
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas

1879
01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.920
And you keep itjust for fun
for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

1880
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.009
They say that when you get married

1881
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.163
It'll be to a millionaire

1882
01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.243
But they don't realize where you came from

1883
01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.129
And I wonder if they really care

1884
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.531
Or give a damn

1885
01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.047
Where do you go to, my lovely

1886
01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.770
When you're alone in your bed?

1887
01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.242
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

1888
01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.884
I want to look inside your head

1889
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.200
Yes, I do

1890
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:31.444
I remember the back streets ofNaples

1891
01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.522
Two children begging in rags

1892
01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.801
Both touched with a burning ambition

1893
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.485
To shake off
their lowly-borne tags

1894
01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.210
They try

1895
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.926
So look into my face
Marie-Claire

1896
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.964
And remember just who you are

1897
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.521
Then go and forget me forever

1898
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.165
But I know you still bear
the scar, deep inside

1899
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.486
Yes, you do

1900
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:09.000
I know where you go to my lovely

1901
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.970
When you're alone in your bed

1902
01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.169
I know the thoughts that surround you

1903
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:24.491
'Cause I can look inside your head

1904
01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.369
People should go back to
watching videos of kittens.

1905
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.124
Now bugger off.

1905
01:30:52.305 --> 01:30:58.468
