One of these days,

314
00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:13.324
Earth and Mars are gonna
bury the hatchet and
hammer out a treaty.

315
00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:15.526
Yeah, and now
you're dreamin', Cap.

316
00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:17.295
McDOWELL: I'm a man
of great vision.
You'll see.

317
00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.330
Means we'll finally get out
of the ice-hauling business

318
00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:21.132
and into the
Earth-Mars business.

319
00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:23.301
Less risk,
way better reward.

320
00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:26.304
Maybe a chance
to see Earth again.

321
00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.306

I wanna see Earth again?

Someday you'll
tell me that story.

325
00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:37.615
Right after you tell me
the story about those.

326

337
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:09.847
Anyone else
in the vicinity?

338
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:13.217
No siree, Bob, we are the only

339
00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:14.819
Of course we are.

340
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.523

341

What the hell were they
doing way out there?

342

We're obligated
to check it out.

343

I'm well aware of the
statute, Ms. Nygaard.

344
00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.237
It's pirate bait.

345
00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:35.506
That far outside
the shipping lanes?

346
00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.442
It's not far out
of our way, Captain.
Two days at most.

347
00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:43.548
A delay means we lose
our berth at Ceres.

348

Kiss our on-time
bonus goodbye.

349

and let the good god
Darwin sort it out.

One of these days,
it's gonna be us
stranded out there.

352
00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.971
Captain gave
an order, people.

353
00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:09.240
Purge the logs.
We never received
that signal.

354
00:20:10.843 --> 00:20:12.877
McDOWELL: Set the watch
and proceed.

355

See, you're a natural.

356

No. That was me
wanting to get to Ceres
worse than you.

You'd be on the
short path to Captain.

365
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.661
Exactly.

366
00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:06.931
Besides, if I took it,
we'd have to stop
seeing each other.
